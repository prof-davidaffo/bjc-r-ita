<h2>Texting Time</h2>
<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you’ll use reporters to transform text messages 🎉 🤩 🐱
      and add your own S👏T👏Y👏L👏E👏, and you'll create descriptions of what
      these reporters do.
    </div>
<h3>Styling Your Text Messages</h3>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>
          Open this
          <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/prog/U1/lab06/texting-time.xml" target="_blank" title="Texting Time - Snap! project">Texting Time</a>
          project, and save it to your account. It includes several blocks that
          process text:<br/>
<img alt="uppercase ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/uppercase.png" title="uppercase ()"/>
<img alt="lowercase ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/lowercase.png" title="lowercase ()"/>
<img alt="clapify ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/clapify.png" title="clapify ()"/>
<img alt="emojify ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/emojify.png" title="emojify ()"/>
<img alt="songify ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/songify.png" title="songify ()"/>
<img alt="shorthand ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/shorthand.png" title="shorthand ()"/>
</li>
<div class="endnote">
          All of these blocks take text as input. For example, the
          <code>uppercase</code> block capitalizes all the English letters in
          the text:<br/>
<img alt="uppercase (be more assertive!) reporting 'BE MORE ASSERTIVE!'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/uppercase-be-more-assertive-reporting.png" title="uppercase (be more assertive!) reporting 'BE MORE ASSERTIVE!'"/>
</div>
<li>
<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>Experiment with the blocks. Try some messages that you might
          actually text to someone. Do the blocks always work like you expect,
          or can you find some inputs that cause them to output strange things?
        </li>
<li>
          Nest the text processing blocks to turn these input strings into the
          target output string:
          <ol>
<li>
              Input: just do it<br/>
              ↳ Output: J👏🏽U👏🏽S👏🏽T👏🏽 D👏🏽O👏🏽 I👏🏽T👏🏽
            </li>
<li>
              Input: Oh Mister Golden Sun - please come out and play<br/>
              ↳ Output: 🎶 oh mister golden ☀️ - please come out and play! 🎵
            </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="clear: right">
          For each of the following blocks, write a description of what the
          block does based on the input given and the output reported.<br/>
<img alt="songify ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/songify.png" title="songify ()"/>
<img alt="emojify ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/emojify.png" title="emojify ()"/>
<img alt="clapify ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/clapify.png" title="clapify ()"/>
<img alt="shorthand ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/shorthand.png" title="shorthand ()"/><br/>
<div class="endnote">
            For example, for the
            <img alt="uppercase ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/uppercase.png" title="uppercase ()"/>
            block, you might write: "This block takes a string of text as input
            and reports the same text but with all of the lowercase letters
            changed to uppercase."
          </div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Adding Program Documentation</h3>

<p>
      Programmers often write descriptions of their code (also called
      <em>documentation</em>) to remind themselves what the code does and to
      help other programmers read, understand, and use it.
    </p>
<p>
      In Snap<em>!</em>, you can use "comments" to document your code. If you
      right-click (or control-click on a Mac) the background of the scripting
      area and choose "add comment," you will get a comment bubble that you can
      drop anywhere in your code. Comments are only for reading by humans; they
      are not run by the computer the way code is.<br/>
<img alt="image of scripting area dropdown menu open showing 'add comment' menu-item selected" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/add-comment.png" title="image of scripting area dropdown menu open showing 'add comment' menu-item selected"/>
</p>
<p>
      Comments can be added near code, between pieces of code, or attached to
      pieces of code.<br/>
<img alt="clapify (emojify (uppercase ('I won the soccer game!'))) with a comment attached on the right side. The comment contains the text 'This script makes my text uppercase, replaces the word 'soccer' with an emoji, and adds clapping hands.'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/attached-comment.png" title="clapify (emojify (uppercase ('I won the soccer game!'))) with a comment attached on the right side. The comment contains the text 'This script makes my text uppercase, replaces the word 'soccer' with an emoji, and adds clapping hands.'"/>
</p>
<p>
      A comment can also be attached to the hat block for a custom block, and
      that text will then appear as the help text for the block. The first step
      is dropping a comment bubble on the hat block of a custom block in the
      block editor:<br/>
<img alt="uppercase block code with a comment attached to the hat block. The comment contains the text 'This block takes a string of text as input and reports the same text but with all of the lowercase letters changed to uppercase.'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/uppercase-hat-block-comment.png" title="uppercase block code with a comment attached to the hat block. The comment contains the text 'This block takes a string of text as input and reports the same text but with all of the lowercase letters changed to uppercase.'"/>
</p>
<p>
      Then, when right-clicking the block and selecting "help" from the dropdown
      menu, you'll see something like:<br/>
<img alt="Help window open with the text 'This block takes a string of text as input and reports the same text but with all of the lowercase letters changed to uppercase.' and an 'OK' button." class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/uppercase-help-text.png" title="Help window open with the text 'This block takes a string of text as input and reports the same text but with all of the lowercase letters changed to uppercase.' and an 'OK' button."/>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>
          Read the help text for the <code>lowercase</code> block, and then open
          the Block Editor for the <code>lowercase</code> block to see how the
          help text was created by adding a comment to the hat block.
        </li>
<li>
          Choose one of the four blocks for which you wrote down a description,
          and use your description to create help text by attaching a comment to
          the hat block.<br/>

<h3>Export Text Messages</h3>
<div class="ifTime show">
<ol start="9">
<li>
          Use the output of these blocks outside of Snap<em>!</em> by using the
          <img alt="export text ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/export-text.png" title="export text ()"/>
          block.

<li>
                Put the block that outputs the text message you wish to export
                into the input slot of the <code>export text</code> block, and
                run the <code>export text</code> block by clicking it.
              </li>
<li>
                Right-click the <var>text to export</var> watcher on the stage,
                and choose "export..." from the dropdown menu.<br/>
<img alt="'text to export' watcher on stage with dropdown menu open showing 'export...' menu-item selected" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/text-to-export-dropdown.png" title="'text to export' watcher on stage with dropdown menu open showing 'export...' menu-item selected"/>
</li>
<li>
                Open the file that is downloaded, copy the text, and paste it
                wherever you want to use it.
              </li>
</ol>

<h3>Draw a Conversation</h3>

        <img alt="draw convo with messages ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab06/draw-convo-with-messages.png" title="draw convo with messages ()"/>
        block takes any number of messages as input and draws as many messages
        as it can fit in a picture of a phone on the stage.
      </p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
          Create a conversation by dragging one of your messages into the block,
          clicking the right arrow to add more slots for additional messages.
        </li>
<li>
          Show your classmates your conversation and check out theirs. A lot can
          happen in a short number of messages!
        </li>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you explored several text-processing blocks, learned
      about program documentation, and used Snap<em>!</em> comments to create
      help text for a block.

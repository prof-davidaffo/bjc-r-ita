<h2><code>Combine</code>-ing Data</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p>
        In this activity, you'll create blocks to make Snap<em>!</em> do math
        with your data for you.
      </p>
</div>
<p>
      Snap<em>!</em> has another built-in block that is useful for data
      analysis: The
      <img alt="combine 'list input slot' using 'predicate input slot'" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/combine.png" title="combine 'list input slot' using 'predicate input slot'"/>
      block combines the elements of a list using an operation. For example,
      this expression adds all the values in the list 0, 1, 2.<br/>
<img alt="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" title="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3"/>
</p>
<div class="takeNote">
<p>
        Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items needs
        has <em>two</em> blank input slots. The <code>keep</code> block only
        needs one blank in its input function, but <code>combine</code> requires
        two slots since it combines an item with the item after it.
      </p>
</div>
<div class="endnote">
<p>
        Unlike <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> which also take functions
        as inputs, the <code>combine</code> function is used with only a few
        input functions.
      </p>
<p>
<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-which-functions" title="Which functions?">Which functions?</a>

<div class="collapse" id="hint-which-functions">
<p>
<code>Combine</code> is mostly used only with these built-in
          functions:<br/>
<img alt="+" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/plus.png" title="+"/>
<img alt="×" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/times.png" title="×"/><br/>
<img alt="and" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/and-block.png" title="and"/>
<img alt="or" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/or-block.png" title="or"/><br/>
<img alt="join" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/join.png" title="join"/>
<img alt="join words" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/join-words.png" title="join words"/><br/>
<img alt="() max ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/max-number-slots.png" title="() max ()"/>
<img alt="() min ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/min-number-slots.png" title="() min ()"/>
</p>
<p>
<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-why-only-these" title="Why can 'combine' only use these functions?">Why only these functions?</a>
</p>
<div class="collapse" id="hint-why-only-these">
<p>
<code>Combine</code> takes a <em>list</em> of values as input. It
            combines the first two values using the input function, then
            combines that result with the third value using the function, then
            combines that result with the next value, and so on.
          </p>
<p>
            So, it can't matter to the input function in what order you group
            the items. Notice that (4 + 1) + 3 is
            the same as 4 + (1 + 3), but
            (4 − 1) − 3 is different from
            4 − (1 − 3). With <code>combine</code>,
            we don't use functions where order matters (such as subtraction or
            division).

<h3>Finding a Maximum or Minimum Value</h3>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>Open your "Data Dos" project if it isn't open already.</li>
<li>
          Locate the
          <img alt="() max ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/max-number-slots.png" title="() max ()"/>
          and
          <img alt="() min ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/min-number-slots.png" title="() min ()"/>
          blocks hidden behind the <code>+</code>, <code>–</code>,
          <code>×</code>, and <code>/</code> functions.
          <div class="endnote">
            To access them, right click the block, select "relabel...", and
            choose the function you want.

</div>
</li>
<li>
          Use these blocks with <code>combine</code> to complete the block
          definitions for
          <img alt="maximum of 'list input slot'" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/maximum-of-list.png" title="maximum of 'list input slot'"/>

          maximum or minimum value in the list.<br/>
<img alt="maximum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting 22" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/max-of-list-reporting.png" title="maximum of list {1, 22, 3, -4} reporting 22"/>

</li>
<li>
          Test your <code>maximum of list</code> and
          <code>minimum of list</code> blocks by dragging a
          <img alt="list ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/list-full-size.png" title="list ()"/>
          block into the input slot, giving it additional input spaces by
          clicking the right-facing triangle, and adding some numbers. Make sure
          both blocks work correctly before moving on.
        </li>
<li>
          Design and answer a question to ask about your data that requires the
          either <code>maximum of list</code> or
          <code>minimum of list</code> block to answer it.
          <div class="endnote" style="clear: right">
            For example, you might ask: "What's the maximum number of years that
            any of the people who responded to my survey have played their
            favorite sport?"

<h3>Finding a Sum</h3>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="6">
<li>
          Complete the block definition for the <code>sum of list</code> block
          so that it reports the sum of the items of a list.<br/>

<li>
          Test the <code>sum of list</code> block with a list of numbers before
          moving on.
        </li>
<li>
          Revisit your investigation topic, and if it makes sense, design and
          answer a question that requires the <code>sum</code> block to answer
          it.
          <div class="endnote">
            For example, you might ask: "How many years in total have the people
            who responded to my survey played their favorite sport?"

                You can find the average of a set of numbers by dividing the sum

</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
          Complete the block definition for the

          of the values in a list:<br/>

                  You'll need the <code>length</code> and

                  <code>sum of list</code> block you just finished building.

          Test your code for the <code>average of list</code> block, and fix any
          problems.

<div class="takeNote">
          Notice that if you hadn't checked that your
          <code>sum of list</code> block works first, then you wouldn't know
          whether any problems with your <code>average of list</code> block were
          really problems with <code>average of list</code> or were actually
          problems with <code>sum of list</code>.

        In this activity, you used the higher-order function
        <code>combine</code> to create <code>maximum of list</code>,
        <code>minimum of list</code>, <code>sum of list</code>, and
        <code>average of list</code> blocks and used them to explore your data.

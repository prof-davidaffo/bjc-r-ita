<h2>Collecting Your Data</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p>
        In this activity, you will gather responses to your survey questions.
      </p>
</div>
<p>
      The data you collect will be stored as table. As you collect data, the
      list will fill up with additional rows, but the survey questions will
      remain as the first row of the survey. For example:<br/>
<img alt="'my survey' watcher: a table with four rows and two columns. Row 1 column 1 has the text: 'How many years have you been playing music?' and row 1 column 2 has the text: 'How many hours do you listen to music each day?' Row 2 has the values '6' and '1'. Row 3 has the values '0' and '3'. Row 4 has the values '2' and '1.5'." class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/my-survey-watcher-questions-and-data.png" title="'my survey' watcher: a table with four rows and two columns.

Row 3 has the values '0' and '3'. Row 4 has the values '2' and '1.5'."/>

      block takes a survey as input and reports its first row with all the
      questions.<br/>
<img alt=" questions only from survey (my survey) reporting the list {How many years have you been playing music?, How many hours do you listen to music each day?}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/questions-only-reporting.png" title="questions only from survey (my survey) reporting the list {How many years have you been playing music?, How many hours do you listen to music each day?}"/>

<h3>Asking the User a Question</h3>

<p>
      This project also includes an
      <img alt="ask ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" title="ask ()"/>
      block that takes a question as input, asks the user the question, and
      reports the user's response.<br/>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>
          If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em>, and open

                The <code>ask</code> block takes a question as input, asks the
                user the question, waits for a response, and then reports the
                user's response as the output of the function.

          What kinds of tools do you still need in order to use
          <code>questions only</code> and <code>ask</code> together to ask the
          user each question from your survey and store that data in the
          <var>my survey</var> variable?

<h3>Adding New Responses to Your Table</h3>
<p>
      The missing tool is the

      block, which performs an action to each item in a list. In this case, the
      action is to <code>ask</code> the user, and the list is the output of
      <code>questions only</code> from <code>my survey</code>.
    </p>
<div class="endnote">
      You learned about the <code>map</code> block in

          so that it takes a survey as input, asks the user each question in the
          survey, and reports a list of the user's responses. Test the block,
          and make sure it works before moving on to the next step: adding the

                questions is left. (The <code>delete</code> block takes a

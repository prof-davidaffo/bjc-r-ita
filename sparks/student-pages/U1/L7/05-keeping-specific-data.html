<h2><code>Keep</code>ing Specific Data</h2>
<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll select only responses that meet specific criteria and count them.</div>
<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> has two built-in blocks that may be useful to your data analysis:
			<ul>
<li>The <img alt="length of 'list input slot'" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/length-list.png" title="length of 'list input slot'"/> block takes a list as input and reports the length of that list.</li>
<li>The <img alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/keep.png" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'"/> block filters a list, reporting back only the items that met certain criteria.</li>
</ul>
<div class="endnote">The <code>keep</code> block is like the <code>find first</code> block you used in the <a href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/student-pages/U1/L6/03-emojify.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&amp;course=sparks.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 3: Emojify">Emojify</a> project. The difference is that <code>keep</code> reports <em>all</em> matching results but <code>find first</code> only reports the <em>first</em> result found.</div>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>Open your "Data Dos" project if it isn't open already.</li>
<li>Test the <code>length</code> block by using it to count the number of responses to your survey.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
			You can use <code>keep</code> to select specific responses. For example, you could keep just the "soccer" responses to question 1:<br/>
<img alt="'my survey' watcher: a table with three rows and two columns. Row 1 column 1 has the text: 'Favorite sport?' and row 1 column 2 has the text: 'Years played?' Row 2 has the values 'soccer' and '4'. Row 3 has the values 'basketball' and '3'. Row 4 has the values 'soccer' and '5'." class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/my-survey-sports-3-rows.png" title="'my survey' watcher: a table with three rows and two columns. Row 1 column 1 has the text: 'Favorite sport?' and row 1 column 2 has the text: 'Years played?' Row 2 has the values 'soccer' and '4'. Row 3 has the values 'basketball' and '3'. Row 4 has the values 'soccer' and '5'."/>
<img alt="keep items (( ) = ('soccer')) from (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey)) reporting the list {'soccer', 'soccer'}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/keep-soccer-from-responses.png" title="keep items (( ) = ('soccer')) from (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey)) reporting the list {'soccer', 'soccer'}"/>
</p>
<p>
			Or as another example, you could keep just the responses to question 2 that were greater than 3: <br/>
<img alt="keep items (( ) &gt; (3)) from (responses to question (2) from survey (my survey)) reporting the list {4, 5}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/keep-gt3-from-responses.png" title="keep items (( ) &gt; (3)) from (responses to question (2) from survey (my survey)) reporting the list {4, 5}"/>
</p>
<div class="endnote">
<p>As with <code>map</code>, the empty slot in the first input to the <code>keep</code> function (that is, in <img alt="( ) = (soccer)" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/equals-soccer.png" title="( ) = (soccer)"/> or <img alt="( ) &gt; (3)" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/greater-than-3.png" title="( ) &gt; (3)"/>) is where each item from the list (e.g., each response to a specific survey question) goes every time the input function (<img alt="( ) = (soccer)" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/equals-soccer.png" title="( ) = (soccer)"/> or <img alt="( ) &gt; (3)" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/greater-than-3.png" title="( ) &gt; (3)"/>) is applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="3">
<li>Try using <code>keep</code> to filter your data at least two times. Filter the data for two different questions using two different criteria. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
			You can use <code>length</code> together with <code>keep</code> to learn specific things about your data. For example, if you wanted to know how many people that you surveyed named soccer as their favorite sport, you could do:<br/>
<img alt="('length') of (keep items (( ) = ('soccer')) from (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey))) reporting '2'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/length-keep-soccer.png" title="('length') of (keep items (( ) = ('soccer')) from (responses to question (1) from survey (my survey))) reporting '2'"/>
</p>
<p>
			And if you wanted to know how many people said that they've played their favorite sport for more than 3 years, you could do: <br/>
<img alt="('length') of (keep items (( ) &gt; (3)) from (responses to question (2) from survey (my survey))) reporting '2'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/length-keep-gt3.png" title="('length') of (keep items (( ) &gt; (3)) from (responses to question (2) from survey (my survey))) reporting '2'"/>

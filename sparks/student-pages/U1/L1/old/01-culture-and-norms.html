          Discuss the growth mindset.
          <ul>
<li>
              When is a time when you used the growth mindset? How did it help
              you?
            </li>
<li>
              When is a time you would have benefited from thinking with a
              growth mindset? what could you do differently in a situation like
              that next time?
            </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
          Part of cultivating a growth mindset is creating a classroom culture
          that supports learning. Work with your class to develop a list of
          classroom norms by responding to these questions:
          <ul>
<li>What makes it easier for you to learn?</li>
<li>What gets in the way of your learning?</li>
<li>
              What classroom norms could we create to facilitate your learning?
              
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
          All levels of computing experience are welcome in this class. To help
          your teacher understand your background, share your responses to these
          questions:
          <ul>
<li>What is your computing experience?</li>
<li>What do you want out of this course?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="learn">

      In this activity, you'll play greet the user in various languages and with

      Snap<em>!</em> is a block-based programming environment designed to teach
      the big ideas of computer science. It can be used to make all sorts of
      programs—image editing, text processing, games, data analysis, scientific
      computation, sound editing, robotics, and more.<br/>

<h3>Making Reporters Report</h3>
<div class="forYouToDo">

          : <strong>Block</strong>
<p>
            A <strong>block</strong> is a piece of code. If you click a block,
            the computer will run the code.
          </p>
</div>

<li>
          Open this
          <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/prog/U1/lab01/say-hello-to-snap.xml" title="Say Hello To Snap - Snap! project">Say Hello To Snap</a>
          project. It has a single <em>block</em> in the "Scripts" area (the
          central space of the Snap<em>!</em> window):<br/>
<img alt="say hello to () in ('English')" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello.png" title="say hello to () in ('English')"/>
</li>
<li>
          Type a name in the blank slot, and click the block to see what
          happens. Did you see a bubble pop-up?<br/>
<img alt="say hello to (Amira) in (English) reporting 'hello, Amira'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-english-with-inputs-reporting.png" title="say hello to (Amira) in (English) reporting 'hello, Amira'"/>
</li>
<li>Change the name, and click the block again.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
      Every Snap<em>!</em> program is made up of blocks like
      <code>say hello</code> that tell the computer what to do. This block says
      hello to someone in a specified language.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="4">
<li>
          Choose a different language from the dropdown menu that says
          "English," and click the block again. What changed about the bubble
          this time?
          <div class="endnote">

      : <strong>Reporters</strong> and <strong>Inputs</strong>
<ul>
<li>
          There are several kinds of blocks in Snap<em>!</em>. The
          <code>say hello</code> block is a <strong>reporter</strong> block.
          (You can tell because it is rounded on the ends.) Reporters do a
          computation and then "report" the result, such as the reporter block
          below that is reporting the text "olá Ana."<br/>
<img alt="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-with-inputs-reporting.png" title="say hello to ('Ana') in ('Portuguese') reporting 'olá Ana'"/><br/>
</li>
<li>
          Many blocks, like <code>say hello</code>, accept an
          <strong>input</strong> that will customize what they do. Inputs appear
          as spaces you can edit. The <code>say hello</code> block accepts two
          inputs: a name and a language. As you've seen, changing the inputs to
          a reporter can change the output it reports.
        </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Blocks Within Blocks</h3>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>
          Find the
          <img alt="fancy ()" class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/fancy.png" title="fancy ()"/>
          reporter block in the palette on the left. Drag it into the Scripts
          area somewhere separate from the <code>say hello</code> block.
        </li>
<li>
          Type a name into the <code>fancy</code> block, and click the block to
          see what it reports. Does it look… Ƒᵃ𝐍𝓬у?
        </li>
<li>
          Snap<em>!</em> got its name because you can <em>snap</em> blocks
          together. Drag the <code>fancy</code> block inside the first input
          slot of the <code>say hello</code> block, replacing the name from
          before. Click the combined expression to see the output.
          <div class="endnote">
<strong>Tip:</strong> When you drag one block inside another block,
            you can see where it will go. It will go in the input slot marked
            with the white box.<br/>
<img alt="An image showing 'fancy(Huan)' being dropped into 'say hello'. There is a white box around the first input of 'say hello' showing where 'fancy(Huan)' will go." class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/drag-and-drop.jpg" title="An image showing 'fancy(Huan)' being dropped into 'say hello'. There is a white box around the first input of 'say hello' showing where 'fancy(Huan)' will go."/>
</div>
          You should see a personalized greeting to a fancy version of the input
          name in the chosen language.<br/>
<img alt="say hello to (fancy('Huan') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'néih hóu ᕼย𝕒Ｎ'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-fancy-with-inputs-reporting.png" title="say hello to (fancy('Huan') in ('Cantonese') reporting 'néih hóu ᕼย𝕒Ｎ'"/>

</li>
<li>
<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>
          Does order matter for blocks inside blocks?
          <ol>
<li>
              What will be the results of clicking the two expressions below?
              Will they be the same or different? Don't check in Snap<em>!</em>.
              Try to figure it out.<br/>
<img alt="say hello to (fancy(Esperanza)) in (Spanish)" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-fancy.png" title="say hello to (fancy(Esperanza)) in (Spanish)"/>
<img alt="fancy (say hello to (Esperanza) in (Spanish))" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/fancy-say-hello.png" title="fancy (say hello to (Esperanza) in (Spanish))"/>
</li>
<li>
              After discussing your ideas, check the difference in
              Snap<em>!</em>. What's going on? Talk to other people until
              everyone understands what's happening.
            </li>

<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you learned to run a block by clicking it, you saw how
      changing the inputs to a reporter block can change its output, and you
      used the output of one reporter as the input to another, making a chain of
      computation.

<h2>Picture of a Pixel</h2>

<div class="learn">In this activity, you'll see how pixels make up an image.</div>
<h3>What's a Pixel?</h3>
<p>The screen you're looking at is an array of thousands, if not millions, of <em>pixels</em>. Each pixel shows a specific amount of red, green, and blue light. By combining different amounts of just those three colors, a pixel can show any of the various colors on a screen.</p>
<p>
			Here's what a white pixel looks like up close:<br/>
<div class="vocabBig">: <strong>Pixel</strong>
<!-- Do not use <strong> for pix/el so they do not end up in the dictionary. -MB -->
<p>A <strong>pixel</strong> (short for <span style="font-weight: bold">pic</span>ture <span style="font-weight: bold">el</span>ement) is the smallest programmable unit of color on a screen.</p>
</div>

</ol>
</div>
<h3>Building Pictures from Pixels</h3>
<p>When a computer draws a picture, it's actually drawing it pixel by pixel, activating the appropriate red, green, and blue components of each pixel in the screen to produce the picture.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="2">
<li>Open this <a class="js-run snap-project" href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/prog/U1/lab04/picture-of-a-pixel.xml&amp;editMode&amp;noRun" target="_blank" title="Picture of a Pixel - Snap! project">Picture of a Pixel</a> project and save it to your account. In this project, you can see for yourself how a computer builds a picture from pixels. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
			The project has a single command block:<br/>
<div class="vocab">: <strong>Resolution</strong>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> is the level of detail in an image.</p>
</div>
<img alt="draw picture ('mystery1') with resolution: ('8')" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab04/draw-picture.png" title="draw picture ('mystery1') with resolution: ('8')"/>
</p>
<p>The <code>draw picture</code> block takes two inputs, the name of a picture and a resolution (the number of pixels wide that the resulting image will be). Both inputs are dropdown menus, so you can click them to select a different value.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="3">
<li>Start with the "mystery1" picture and the lowest resolution (8), and click the block. The command will paint an eight-pixel wide image of the "mystery1" picture on the stage. You probably can't recognize the picture yet.</li>
<li>Keep increasing the resolution and clicking the block. Try setting the resolution to 16, then 24, then 32, then 48, then 64, then 96, and finally 128. At what resolution are you able to recognize the image?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
			Eventually, with enough pixels, the picture should become quite clear. Here's an example: <br/>
<div class="sidenoteBig">Click the image for an animation.</div>
<img alt="pixelated image of a sea turtle becoming increasingly more clear. The image starts at resolution 8, then goes to 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, and finally 128." class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab04/turtle-pixel-animation.gif" title="pixelated image of a sea turtle becoming increasingly more clear. The image starts at resolution 8, then goes to 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, and finally 128."/>
<div class="endnote">
<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-dark" title="Why does the higher resolution image look dark?">Why does the higher resolution image look dark?</a>
<div class="collapse" id="hint-dark">
<p>These aren't
		<em>really</em> pixels, because even the block's
		highest resolution, 128, is <em>much</em> lower than
		your screen's actual resolution. These are <em>models</em> of pixels created to show you how pixels combine to make images. Each of these "fake pixels" can only be <em>at most</em> one third as bright as a real pixel because each part of one of these fake pixels is displayed on your screen by real pixels that each only include a third (one color) of that real pixel's total possible brightness.</p>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>
					Reset the resolution to 8 and try doing the same thing with some of the other mystery pictures.
					<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>
<ol>
<li>Are some of the pictures easier to guess at low resolution than others?</li>
<li>Do you notice any patterns with the RGB (red, green, blue) contents of the pixels and how they eventually change?</li>
<li>What do you notice about the relationship between image resolution and how long it takes for the computer to draw the image?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="learn">In this activity, you learned: (1) images are made up of pixels (tiny squares with different amounts of red, green, and blue), (2) resolution controls the number of pixels used to make up an image, and (3) higher resolution images are more detailed and more recognizable.</div>

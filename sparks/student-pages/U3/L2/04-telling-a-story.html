<h2>Telling a Story</h2>

<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you'll bring your pet to life using cardboard, paper,
      and code.
    </div>
<p>
      Now that you've made your interactive pet, document its interactions so
      that a classmate can know how to interact with it.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>
          Describe your pet, how you interact with it (the inputs and outputs),
          and a story about your pet.
        </li>
<li>
          Write up your description to place next to your pet. When classmates
          or others visit your pet, they should know how to interact with it
          based on your text.

            don't wait too long or else it will die. You can bring the pet back
            to life by pressing both buttons at the same time.</i>

        It's helpful to share your designs with others for design feedback, to
        share ideas, and to test that your project works as intended. Share your
        pet with a partner by telling its story of how to interact with it. If
        something doesn't work as intended, make your desired changes to your
        design.

<h2>Tiny Animation</h2>

<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you'll write a script make an animation appear on the
      LED screen by switching between two screens.
    </div>
<p>
      To start, you'll make an animation flipping between a smile and a frown.
    </p>

          If it isn't already, open
          <a class="" href="https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html" target="_blank" title="MicroBlocks">MicroBlocks</a>, and connect your micro:bit.

            Design your LED pattern by clicking on individual rectangles to
            light them up.

          Create two face designs on two copies of the
          <code>display</code> block.<br/>

<strong>Tip:</strong> Animations are a rapid sequence of images
            displayed in a row. To bring your face to life, you'll need to
            switch between <code>display</code> blocks quickly, but not too
            quickly. To achieve this, use a <code>wait</code> block after each
            <code>display</code>. Adjust with the amount of time the program
            waits to what you like.
          </div>
</li>
<li>
          Once your animation is playing on the micro:bit, create your own
          animation by switching between two <code>display</code> blocks.
        </li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Make an Interactive Animation</h3>
<p>
      So far, your animation changes on its own, but you can control when it
      changes for example, by using the micro:bit's LEDs as light sensors. The
      LEDs can detect different levels of light, and you can program the
      micro:bit to change the animation depending on how much light they detect.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>
          Use an <code>if</code> block together with a
          <code>light level</code> block to change the image on the LED screen
          based on the light detected.<br/>

<div class="endnote">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Light levels vary greatly depending on the
            room that you're in, so you'll need to experiment with values for
            your program considers bright or dark, and you may need to change it
            later for a different room. One way to do this is to use the
            <code>say</code> block.

<div class="ifTime show">
<ol start="6">
<li>
          Make a more complicated animation by adding more
          <code>display</code> blocks or varying the <code>wait</code> time.

          Make a nametag:
          <ol>
<li>
              Use some of the other blocks in the "LED Display" library to
              display your name on your micro:bit. You can do this one letter at
              a time, or scrolling across the screen.
            </li>
<li>
              Save your project to your micro:bit (your micro:bit appears as a
              drive on your computer). Then click on the USB icon with the green
              circle at the top of the page, choose "disconnect," physically
              unplug the micro:bit from the computer, and connect a battery pack
              to have a portable digital nametag.

      In this activity, you used <code>display</code> blocks together with
      <code>forever</code>, <code>wait</code>, and <code>light level</code> to
      create animations controlled by pauses and by light.

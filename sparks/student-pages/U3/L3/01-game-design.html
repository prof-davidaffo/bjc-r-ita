<h2>Game Design</h2>

<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you'll start making a game (or reimagine an existing
      one) that uses micro:bit using light level, buttons, or tilt to be played
      either individually or with others.
    </div>
<h3>Collect Materials</h3>
<p>
      For each activity, we'll provide you with a list of materials to gather
      and some suggested materials.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>
<img alt="Gather Materials" class="inline noshadow" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/gather-materials.png" title="Gather Materials"/>
<ul>
<li>Pencils or pens</li>
<li>Paper</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Get Started</h3>
<p>
      Think of a game you've played many times, and imagine how adding code
      could enhance the experience. You'll make a game that uses the micro:bit
      only or uses the micro:bit as a part to the game alongside other general
      craft materials.
    </p>
<p>
      Before building, decide whether you would like your game to be played with
      the micro:bit only or if you want to include additional materials.
      Consider these two examples as you and your partner decide what type of
      game to make.
    </p>
<h3>Example 1: Fast Click</h3>
<p>
      In this game, players click the A and B buttons as quickly as they can.
      After the micro:bit displays ”GO”, Player A and B will try to click their
      respective buttons as fast as possible. The player able to click their
      button 10 times the fastest wins. The LEDs will then display the letter of
      which player (A or B) won the round.
    </p>

<img alt="code blocks for fast click" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U3/L3/fast-click.png" title="Fast Click blocks" width="450"/>
<p>
      Fast Click keeps track of the score using a <strong>variable</strong>. We
      first learned about variables in
      <a href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/student-pages/U1/L7/02-setting-up.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&amp;course=middle-school.html">Unit 1 Lab 7: Dealing with Data Dos, Activity 2.</a>
      Here are some key pieces of information to remember:
    </p>
<div class="vocabFullWidth">
      : <strong>Variable</strong>
<p>
        A <strong>variable</strong> is like a labeled box that can store a
        value, such as a word, a number, or a list.
      </p>
</div>
<p>
      Create a new variable in MicroBlocks by selecting the Variables tab on the
      left. Select <strong>Add a variable</strong> and give it a name that's
      meaningful to your project. You will then have access to set and use your
      variable in your script.
    </p>
<img alt="MicroBlocks before a variable has been added" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U3/L3/variable-before.png" title="add a variable" width="300"/>
<img alt="dialogue box to add a new variable" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U3/L3/variable-new.png" title="create a new variable" width="300"/>
<img alt="newly created variable in MicroBlocks" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U3/L3/variable-after.png" title="variable now available in MicroBlocks" width="300"/>
<h3>Example 2: Skeeball</h3>
<p>
      A toilet paper tube transforms into a basket for catching a ball.
      Alligator clips to make a homemade switch, so when the ball is inside the
      tube, it completes the circuit. I really like this technique and hope we
      can use it more! I'm also using a counter to keep track of every time the
      ball goes in the hole.
    </p>
<img alt="tube ball player scores one point by shooting the ball into the basket" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U3/L3/skeeball.gif" title="Skeeball" width="400"/>

<div class="endnote">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Add scrolling text to your micro:bit by adding the
      Scrolling library in MicroBlocks.
      <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-drop" title="Click for a picture of how to know where a block you are dragging will drop">Click for a picture.</a>
<div class="collapse" id="hint-drop">
<img alt="highlighted text to find the scrolling library" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U3/L3/scrolling-library.png" title="scrolling library" width="850"/>
</div>
</div>
<p>
      Tube Ball uses the input and output pins, a new input type, to determine
      if the ball makes it into the basket. Use the
      <code>read analog pin</code> blocks to determine whether an action has
      occurred or not using a switch.
    </p>
<div class="vocabFullWidth">
      : <strong>Analog Input Pin</strong> and <strong>Switch</strong>
<p>
        An <strong>analog input pin</strong> can read a voltage level that
        ranges of voltages provided to your micro:bit.
      </p>
<p>
        A <strong>switch</strong> is an electronic device that disconnects or
        connects and electrical path, resulting in a circuit turning off or on.
      </p>
</div>
<p>
      Make a switch using your micro:bit by connecting alligator clip wires to
      <strong>pin 0</strong> and <strong>GND</strong>. Start by connecting these
      two alligator clips together and you've got a switch! Use another
      conductive material like aluminum foil to add more complex shapes to your
      game design.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>
            Brainstorm the game that you would like to bring to life. Use
            micro:bit inputs and outputs that you know to incorporate into game
            play, such as:
          </p>
<strong>Inputs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Light level</li>
<li>A or B button</li>
<li>Tilt x, y, or z</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outputs:</strong> LED display</p>
</li>
<li>
<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>
          Think first on your own and then discuss with a partner:
        </li>
<ul>
<li>What are the rules to the game?</li>
<li>How will the game start? How will players know when it ends?</li>
<li>Is it single player, or can it be played collaboratively?</li>
</ul>
<li>
          Write down your plans on a piece of paper. Draw out what the game will
          look like, including any physical materials you'll need and how your
          game will work.
        </li>
</ol>

      In this activity, you made plans to make an interactive game with your

<h2>Sprite Costumes and Stage Backgrounds</h2>

<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you will learn about sprites (characters) and their
      costumes as well as the Snap<em>!</em> stage and its background.
    </div>
<div class="sidenote">
      You first learned about sprites, costumes, and the Snap<em>!</em> stage in
      <a href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/student-pages/U1/L4/03-investigating-and-storing-images.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&amp;course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images">Unit 1 Lab 4 Activity 3: Investigating and Storing Images</a>.

<p>
      Your project should have characters or objects that move around
      (<em>sprites</em>) on top of a background image (the Snap<em>!</em>
<em>stage</em>). You'll control how the sprites look by changing their
      <em>costumes</em>, and you'll control how the stage looks by changing its
      <em>background</em>.
    </p>
<p>
      Here are a few of the costumes included in Snap<em>!</em>. You can also
      import your own.<br/>

<ul>
<li>
          A <strong>sprite</strong> is like an actor who can do many different
          things, such as move, talk, follow other sprites, and whatever else
          you program it to do!
        </li>
<li>
          A <strong>costume</strong> is a picture that can be "worn" by a
          sprite.
        </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
      Here are a few of the backgrounds included in Snap<em>!</em>. You import
      your own backgrounds too.<br/>

          The <strong>stage</strong> is the big rectangle in the upper right of
          the Snap<em>!</em> window. (It's white when you first open
          Snap<em>!</em>.) The stage is what users of your project see, and it's
          where your sprites live.

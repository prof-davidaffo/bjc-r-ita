<h2>Importing Code</h2>
<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you'll incorporate blocks from other projects.
    </div>
<div class="sidenote">
      You first learned about importing blocks in
      <a href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/student-pages/U1/L7/07-gathering-visualizing.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&amp;course=sparks.html" target="_blank" title="Unit 1 Lab 7 Activity 7: Visualizing and Reflecting on Your Results">Unit 1 Lab 7 Activity 7: Visualizing and Reflecting on Your Results</a>.
    </div>
<p>
      Some blocks you've used are built into Snap<em>!</em>. For example:<br/>
<img alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/map.png" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'"/>
<img alt="repeat () {}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/repeat.png" title="repeat () {}"/>
<img alt="join () ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/join.png" title="join () ()"/>
</p>
<p>
      Other blocks you've used are custom blocks that were developed for this
      course. For example:<br/>
<img alt="say hello to () in ('English')" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello.png" title="say hello to () in ('English')"/>
<img alt="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab04/rgb-pixel.png" title="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)"/>
<img alt="ask ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" title="ask ()"/>
</p>
<p>
      And you've created some blocks of your own that aren't built into
      Snap<em>!</em>. For example:<br/>
<img alt="mystery song" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/mystery-song.png" title="mystery song"/>
<img alt="message () shifted by ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab05/message-shifted-by.png" title="message () shifted by ()"/>
<img alt="responses only from survey 'list input slot'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/responses-only.png" title="responses only from survey 'list input slot'"/>
</p>
<p>
      When you want to use a block that isn't available in your current project,
      you can open a project where you already have that block, export it (save
      it to your computer), open the project where you want the block, and
      import it (upload it from your computer).

                      If you want to export a block that uses other custom

                      automatically, and you won't be able to deselect them
                      unless you first deselect the block(s) that use them.

<h2>Greeting Card</h2>

<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>
          Create an eCard that meets all of the following specifications:
          <ol>
<li>
              Has a message for the viewer (such as "Happy New Year," "Happy
              Birthday," "Get Well Soon," etc.)
            </li>
<li>
              Has a theme (such as holiday, sports, TV show, a photo, original
              art, etc.)
            </li>
<li>Has stage and sprite costumes</li>
<li>Works properly (is not buggy)</li>
<li>
              Includes a custom block. This can be either:
              <ul>
<li>
                  A <code>start over</code> block that resets the eCard to the
                  beginning (resets pen, stage, and sprites) OR
                </li>
<li>
                  Another custom block containing at least 3 blocks (this could
                  move a sprite, change the background, etc.)
                </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
              Uses a loop (such as <code>repeat until</code> or
              <code>for</code>)
            </li>
<li>
              Lets the user interact (e.g., by clicking a sprite, pressing a
              key, or moving the mouse)
            </li>
<li>
              Includes one additional feature. For example, you can choose
              <ul>
<li>
                  Sounds or music (using the play block and/or the "Sounds" tab)
                </li>
<li>The <code>random</code> block</li>
</ul>
<div class="endnote">
<strong>Note: Sound files</strong> can be imported into Snap!
                projects, but which media types work depends on the local
                computer's browser and security settings. Regarding file size,
                there is no fixed limit, but large files and limited bandwidth
                situations can slow or timeout file transfers. Classrooms with
                limited bandwidth connections may opt to avoid sound importing
                altogether.

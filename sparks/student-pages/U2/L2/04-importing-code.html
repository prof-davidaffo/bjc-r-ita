<h2>Importing Code</h2>
<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you'll incorporate blocks from other projects.
    </div>
<p>
      Some blocks you've used are built into Snap<em>!</em>. For example:<br/>
<img alt="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/map.png" title="map 'reporter input slot' over 'list input slot'"/>
<img alt="repeat () {}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/repeat.png" title="repeat () {}"/>
<img alt="join () ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/join.png" title="join () ()"/>
</p>
<p>
      Other blocks you've used are custom blocks that were developed for this
      course. For example:<br/>
<img alt="say hello to () in ('English')" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello.png" title="say hello to () in ('English')"/>
<img alt="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab04/rgb-pixel.png" title="RGB pixel, red: (85) green: (170) blue: (255)"/>
<img alt="ask ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" title="ask ()"/>
</p>
<p>
      And you've created some blocks of your own that aren't built into
      Snap<em>!</em>. For example:<br/>
<img alt="mystery song" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/mystery-song.png" title="mystery song"/>
<img alt="message () shifted by ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab05/message-shifted-by.png" title="message () shifted by ()"/>
<img alt="responses only from survey 'list input slot'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/responses-only.png" title="responses only from survey 'list input slot'"/>
</p>
<p>
      When you want to use a block that isn't available in your current project,
      you can open a project where you already have that block, export it (save
      it to your computer), open the project where you want the block, and
      import it (upload it from your computer).

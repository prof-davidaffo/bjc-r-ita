<h2>Programming Styles</h2>
<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you'll learn about the difference between programming by
      nesting reporter blocks inside each other and programming by stacking
      command blocks top to bottom.
    </div>
<h3>Commands Versus Reporters</h3>
<p>
      Before this unit, you nested blocks inside each other so that the output
      reported by one block became the input to another. That style of
      programming is known as <em>functional programming</em>, and in
      Snap<em>!</em>, it uses <em>reporter</em> blocks. A reporter computes a
      value and reports it (to you or to other blocks).<br/>

</p>
<p>
      In this unit, you've been stacking blocks that carry out
      <em>actions,</em> such as playing a note. This style of programming is
      called <em>imperative programming</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, imperative
      programming uses <em>command</em> blocks. A command tells the computer to
      do something, (play a sound, draw, move, change something, etc.). Commands
      have <em>effects.</em><br/>

play ♪ pitch: (59) beats: (0.5)

<p>
      The shapes of the blocks go with the shapes of the places where you can
      use them. Reporters are round, and they go into round slots in a block.
      Commands are more rectangular, and they have a tab at the bottom that fits
      into the gap at the top of another command block. Snap<em>!</em> won't let
      you put a reporter in a stack of commands or put a command in a round
      slot.

        A <strong>reporter</strong> block does a calculation and reports the
        result. Reporters have an oval shape. <br/>

<p>
        A <strong>predicate</strong> is a special kind of reporter that asks a
        true/false question and reports either true or false. Predicates have a
        hexagon shape.<br/>

<div class="sidenote">You'll use commands much more in Unit 2.</div>
<p>
        A <strong>command</strong> block tells the computer to do something
        <em>without reporting a value</em>. Commands have a puzzle shape and can
        be snapped together one after another. <br/>

<div class="endnote" style="clear: right">
        Unlike reporters, a command block doesn't report anything, so you can't
        use its result as the input to another block—its result is an
        action, not a value!

<h3>Creating a Command Block</h3>
<p>
      You've created a reporter block before. You can create a command block in
      almost exactly the same way.

          If your project isn't open already, log in to Snap<em>!</em>, and open
          your "Song Player" project.
        </li>

<li>
          Create a new command block called <code>mystery song</code>.
          <ol>
<li>
              Right-click in an empty spot in the Scripts area and choose "make
              a block..." <br/>
<img alt="make a block option" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/make-a-block.jpg" title="make a block option"/>
</li>
<li>Choose the palette for your block: Sound.</li>

<li>
              Type the title (name) for your block: <code>mystery song</code>.

<li>Select the shape for your block: Command.</li>
<li>Click "OK."</li>

      When you create a reporter, the block editor opens with
      <img alt="report" class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/report.png" title="report"/>
      attached to the hat block, and whatever input you give to
      <code>report</code> will be the value reported by the new reporter. When
      you create a command, the block editor opens with only the hat block, and
      the blocks attached below it will run (one at a time) when the new command
      is run.

            Hiding away the details of how code works (such as by moving it

          Inside the <code>mystery song</code> block, either build a new song
          for someone else to guess or drag in a song you have already created
          and attach it to the <code>mystery song</code> hat block.
        </li>

<li>
          Play your mystery song for someone else, and see if they can guess
          what it is. Then guess someone else's song.

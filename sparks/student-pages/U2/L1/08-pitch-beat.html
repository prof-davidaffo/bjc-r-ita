<h2>Songs with Pitches <em>and</em> Beats</h2>

<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn to store and play songs with both pitch and length of each note.</div>
<p>
			So far, you've been using a <code>play song</code> block that only lets you control the pitch of each note (by giving it a list of pitches as input). The number of beats was the same based on whatever you typed into the <code>play ♪</code> block inside your <code>play song</code> block (for example, 0.5 in the image below).<br/>
<img alt="play song (pitches) {
	for each (pitche) in (pitches) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch) beats: (0.5)
	}
}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-definition.png" title="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-definition.png"/>
</p>
<p>
			You can use a table to store the data for every note and then use <code>play song with pitches and beats</code>, which expects music data <em>in a table</em>, to play the song. Each item in the list below is a new block: <img alt="♪ pitch: () beats: ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/note-pitch-beats.png" title="♪ pitch: () beats: ()"/>. It looks like the <code>play ♪</code> command, but it's a reporter that reports the pitch and beat.<br/>
<img alt="set ('Mario Theme (with beats)') to (list (♪ pitch: (76) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (76) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (0) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (76) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (0) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (72) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (76) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (0) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (79) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (0) beats: (0.75)) (♪ pitch: (67) beats: (0.25)))" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/set-mario-beats.png" title="set ('Mario Theme (with beats)') to (list (♪ pitch: (76) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (76) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (0) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (76) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (0) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (72) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (76) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (0) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (79) beats: (0.25)) (♪ pitch: (0) beats: (0.75)) (♪ pitch: (67) beats: (0.25)))"/>

					This block takes a table of pitch and beat values as input, and for each note in the song, it plays the pitch and beat values for that note:<br/>

					The data about each note is loaded in to a table using the <code>♪ pitch beats</code> block, which takes a pitch and number of beats as input and reports a list with those two values:<br/>

		report (list (pitch) (beats))

<p>
					Each note (<var>♪</var>) in the song now has both pitch and beat information, and <code>play ♪</code> needs to receive those data in separate input slots. The <img alt="pitch from ♪" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/pitch.png" title="pitch from ♪"/> and <img alt="beats from ♪" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/beats.png" title="beats from ♪"/> blocks each take a note (<var>♪</var>) as input and report only one piece of information to the <code>play ♪</code> block.<br/>
<img alt="pitch (♪) {
		report (item (1) of (♪))
	}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/pitch-definition.png" title="pitch (♪) {
		report (item (1) of (♪))
	}"/>
<img alt="beats (♪) {
		report (item (2) of (♪))
	}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/beats-definition.png" title="beats (♪) {
		report (item (2) of (♪))
	}"/>
</p>
<p>
					So, <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> takes a table of song data with pitches and beats as input (<code>song</code>), and it plays each note (<var>♪</var>) at the specified pitch for the specified number of beats.<br/>
<img alt="play song with pitches and beats (song) {
	for each (♪) in (song) {
		play ♪ pitch: (pitch from ♪ (♪)) beats: (beats from ♪ (♪))
	}
}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-definition.png" title="play song with pitches and beats (song) {
	for each (♪) in (song) {

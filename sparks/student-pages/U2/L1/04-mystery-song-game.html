<h2>Mystery Song Game</h2>
<div class="learn">In this activity, you will use your <code>mystery song</code> block to create a game.</div>
<p>
			There are command block versions of two blocks you've already seen:
			<ul>
<li>
					You've used the <img alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()"/> reporter. Snap<em>!</em> also 	has a built-in command version:
					<img alt="if 'predicate input slot' then 'C-shaped input slot' else 'C-shaped input slot'" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/if-else-full-size.png" title="if 'predicate input slot' then 'C-shaped input slot' else 'C-shaped input slot'"/>
<div class="endnote">
<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-if" title="Learn more about the difference between the reporter IF THEN ELSE and the command IF ELSE.">Learn more about the difference between the reporter <code>if then else</code> and the command <code>if else</code>.</a>
<div class="collapse" id="hint-if">

								In <a href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/student-pages/U1/L6/02-l33t-text.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&amp;course=middle-school.html" title="Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text">Unit 1 Lab 6 Activity 2: L33t Text</a>, you used <img alt="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/reporter-if.png" title="if 'predicate input slot' then () else ()"/> to decide what the computer should <em>report</em>. You can use the command version to decide what the computer should <em>do</em>. Like the reporter version, the command <code>if else</code> block takes three inputs:
								<ol>
<li>A testing condition (such as <img alt="(answer) = ('Stronger')" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/answer-equals-stronger.png" title="(answer) = ('Stronger')"/>)</li>
<li>What to do if it's true</li>
<li>What to do if it's false</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The command block, however, performs a set of commands depending on the result of the condition rather than reporting an output.</p>

</div>
</div>
</li>

<li>
					You've used the <img alt="ask ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab07/ask.png" title="ask ()"/> reporter. Snap<em>!</em> has a built-in command version:
					<img alt="ask () and wait" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/ask-empty-full-size.png" title="ask () and wait"/>, which uses
					<img alt="answer" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/answer-full-size.png" title="answer"/> to report the user's response.

To use Snap<em>!</em>'s built-in version, first use the command <img alt="ask () and wait" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/ask-empty-full-size.png" title="ask () and wait"/> to ask the user your question and then use the reporter <img alt="answer" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/answer-full-size.png" title="answer"/> to access the answer stored the last time <code>ask and wait</code> was run.

<p>You can use <code>ask and wait</code> to ask the user a question (and store their response), and you can use <img alt="say ()" class="nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/say-empty-full-size.png" title="say ()"/> to tell the user something that isn't a question.</p>

								The script for your game needs to do three things:

<li>Play your mystery song</li>

<li>Tell the player whether the guess is correct</li>

<h2>Visualizing Loops</h2>
<div class="learn">In this activity, you will experiment with <em>loops</em> and see how they control the order in which the commands are run.</div>
<h3>Using Visible Stepping</h3>
<p>Snap<em>!</em> has a tool called <strong>Visible Stepping</strong> that allows you to watch Snap<em>!</em> process the blocks of your code in order. </p>

					Discuss what happens when the script is run. In what order does Snap<em>!</em> run these instructions? Why does the song get faster?

					Now, open your "Song Player" project from the previous activity page, click the Visible Stepping button, and play your song.

Visible Stepping (<img alt="Visible Stepping button with two footprints" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/visible-stepping.png" title="Visible Stepping button with two footprints"/>) can be useful when reading code because you can see what block is running.</div>
<h3>Looping Your Song</h3>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="4">
<div class="vocab">: <strong>Looping</strong> or <strong>Iteration</strong>
<p>Repeating the same set of commands (such as with <code>repeat</code> or <code>forever</code>) is called <strong>looping</strong> or <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>
</div>
<li>
					If you haven't already, try using the <code>repeat</code> block to repeat a note or a sequence of notes in a song. Play your song with Visible Stepping turned on.<br/>
<img alt="repeat () {}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/repeat.png" title="repeat () {}"/>
</li>
<li>Try nesting one <code>repeat</code> inside another as in the "Für Elise" example above.</li>
<li>
					Try using a <code>forever</code> block to repeat a command (or group of commands) forever, and play your song with Visible Stepping on.<br/>
<img alt="forever" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/forever-full-size.png" title="forever"/>
<div class="takeNote" style="clear: right;">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you stop it. You can <strong>click the red stop sign</strong> (<img alt="red stop button" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" title="red stop button"/>) to stop all scripts in your project from running, or you can click an individual script to stop it.</div>
</li>
<li><img alt="Now Is a Good Time to Save" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-now.png" title="Now Is a Good Time to Save"/></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="learn">In this activity, you used <em>iteration</em> by repeating a set of commands.

<h2>Song <code>Map</code>per</h2>

<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you will use the <code>map</code> block to transpose
      (shift) all the pitches in your song.
    </div>


<p>
      Another advantage of using a list to store your notes is that you can use
      higher order functions to process your list. You can use
      <code>map</code> to play a song higher or lower than the original
      pitches.<br/>
<img alt="map (( ) + (3)) over (list ((64) (62) (60) (62) (64) (64) (64))) reporting the list 67, 65, 63, 65, 67, 67, 67" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/map-plus-3-over-notes-list.png" title="map (( ) + (3)) over (list ((64) (62) (60) (62) (64) (64) (64))) reporting the list 67, 65, 63, 65, 67, 67, 67"/>
</p>
<p>
      If you store the list of pitches in a variable, you can use
      <code>play song</code> together with <code>map</code> to play the same
      song several times in different ways.<br/>

Click each block to: set the variable, play the song, and then play
          the transposed (shifted) song.
        </li>
<li>
          Try changing the <em>shift</em> (the second input to the
          <code>+</code> function in the <code>map</code> block) from 3 to some
          other integer. (You can make it any integer—positive or
          negative—but if it's too high or low, you won't be able to hear
          the song).
        </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
      The <code>map</code> block takes two inputs: a function (in this case
      <img alt="( ) + (3)" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/plus-3.png" title="( ) + (3)"/>) and a list, applies the function to each item in the list, and reports
      a new list of the results.

      : <strong>Higher-Order Function</strong>
<p>
        Recall, a function that takes a function as input (like
        <code>map</code>) is called a <strong>higher-order function</strong>.

          Open your latest project in Snap<em>!</em>, and use
          <code>map</code> and <code>play song</code> together with one of the
          variables that you used to store your pitches to make your song more
          complex.
        </li>
<li>
          Add additional variables to store different verses, and create more
          interesting music.
        </li>

<li>
          In this activity, you changed the pitches by adding or subtracting,
          but you could also multiply or divide. Try it and see what happens!
          <div class="endnote">
            You can pull the <code>map</code> block out of the
            <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> block temporarily and
            then click it to see what values it reports.

      In this activity, you used the higher order function <code>map</code> to

<h2><code>Map</code>ping over Pitches and Beats</h2>

<div class="learn">In this activity, you will learn how to transpose data in a song that is stored in a table.</div>
<p>
			You've learned how to use <code>map</code> to transpose (shift) all the pitch values in a song where each note plays for the same length, and you've learned how to use a table to store both pitch and beat values for the notes in a song. You can also transpose the pitch values stored in a table.<br/>

			This code is a bit complicated. Notice that it plays a version of <var>Mario Theme</var> that has gone through the <code>map</code> block. So the question is: What does this <code>map</code> block do?
		</p>

<p style="clear: right;">
			Recall that <code>play song with pitches and beats</code> expects a table of song data as input, <code>map</code> works through every item in a list, and every item in the table of pitches and beats is one note. So, <code>map</code> applies a function to every note in the <var>Mario Theme</var> and  outputs a table of notes (pairs of pitches and beats).<br/>

The rows contain the value pairs: (76, 0.25), (76, 0.25), (0, 0.25), (76, 0.25), (0, 0.25), (72, 0.25), (76, 0.25), (0, 0.25), (79, 0.25), (0, 0.75), (67, 0.25)" class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/mario-beats-watcher.png" title="watcher for the 'Mario Theme (with beats)' variable showing a table with two columns and eleven rows.

<p>
			In order for <code>map</code> to output a table of pitches and beats, it needs to apply a function that outputs pairs of pitches and beats. So the code needs a structure like this:<br/>
<img alt="" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map01.png" title=""/>
</p>
<p>
			What function outputs pitches and beats? The <img alt="♪ pitch () beats ()" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/note-pitch-beats.png" title="♪ pitch () beats ()"/> block. So the code needs a structure like this:<br/>

<img alt="" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map02.png" title=""/>
</p>
<p>But remember that the inputs that end up in the blank spots of the function in the <code>map</code> block each time it applies the function are the items in the input list, which in this case are the notes (pitches and beats from <var>Mario Theme (with beats)</var>).</p>
<p>
			So, to get a beats value in the beats slot, we need to use the <code>beats from ♪</code> block, which takes a note (with a pitch and a beat) and reports just the beat.<br/>

<img alt="" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/play-song-beats-mario-map03.png" title=""/>
</p>
<p>
			And to get a pitch value in the pitch slot, we need to use the <code>pitches from ♪</code> block, and we need to add our shift value to do the transpose.<br/>

								Your code should look like this but with your own song variable in place of <var>Mario Theme (with beats)</var> and a different shift value (instead of 5).<br/>

<strong>Tip:</strong> Try shifts like 1, 4, 7 and see which sound good to you. What about other shifts?

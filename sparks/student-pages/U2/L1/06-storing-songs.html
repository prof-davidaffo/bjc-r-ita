      lab, you began using <em>local variables</em> to access the inputs to a
      block you were editing. Those variables were only available within that
      block.<br/>

      When you need a variable to be available <em>anywhere</em> in your
      project, you can use a <em>global variable</em>.

      : <strong>Global Variable</strong>
<p>
        A <strong>global variable</strong> is a variable that is usable by all
        scripts in the program.
      </p>
</div>
<p>
      For example, you can use a global variable to store the pitches of a
      song.<br/>
<img alt="set ('Mary Had a Little Lamb') to (list (64) (62) (60) (62) (64) (64) (64) (0) (62) (62) (62) (0) (64) (67) (67)))" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U2/lab01/set-mary-lamb.png" title="set ('Mary Had a Little Lamb') to (list (64) (62) (60) (62) (64) (64) (64) (0) (62) (62) (62) (0) (64) (67) (67)))"/>

                Type the name for your variable. (Use the name of the song or
                something else to help you remember it. Don't forget that the
                name can have spaces in it—it doesn't have to be just one word.)

          Create another global variable and make it store a different song.<br/>

          showing and hiding your song variables.<br/>

          You can use variables to store pieces of a song and then snap several
          <code>play song</code> blocks together to play the same parts of a
          song more than once. Try building a more complicated song that way.

<h2>Making Noise</h2>
<div class="learn">
      In this activity, you will make a noise sample from scratch by making the
      computer play a set of random volume intensities.
    </div>

<p>
      Sound is pressure waves, and the patterns of those waves determine what
      the sound <em>sounds like</em>. In Snap<em>!</em>, sounds can be generated
      as lists of volume intensities. You'll start by creating one second of
      "noise", which is just random intensities that sound like static.

<li>Open your "Sparks-Making-Noise" project if isn't open already.</li>
<li>
          Create a variable called <code>noise</code> to store the intensity
          values, and make it start as an empty list.<br/>

          What is the difference between the inputs of the following two
          expressions? What is the difference between their outputs? <br/>

          What will this code do? <br/>

          Look at the variable watcher on the Snap<em>!</em> stage to confirm.

                The above code repeatedly adds a random number between -1 and 1
                to the <var>noise</var> variable.
              </li>
<li>
                The first input to <code>pick random</code> is -0.99999 instead
                of -1 to force that block to output decimals rather than only
                integers.

<li>
                The <code>add</code> block is repeated
                <var>sampling rate</var> number of times.
              </li>
<li>
                The <code>warp</code> block acts like a time-warp to speed
                things up.

          : <strong>Sample Rate</strong>
<p>
            The <strong>sample rate</strong> is how many intensity samples fit
            in one second of sound samples detected by the microphone.<br/>

          Build that code in Snap<em>!</em>, then drag the
          <var>noise</var> variable into the <code>play</code> block,
          <strong>turn down the volume</strong>, and play the noise. Debug your

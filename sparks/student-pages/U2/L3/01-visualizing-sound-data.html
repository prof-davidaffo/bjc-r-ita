<h2>Visualizing Sound Data</h2>

<div class="learn">In this activity, you will explore the sound data from your computer's microphone and learn to draw in Snap<em>!</em>.</div>
<p>
			Snap<em>!</em> can access your computer's microphone, so you can create a virtual <em>oscilloscope</em> that shows how the volume detected by the microphone changes over time.<br/>

<ul>
<li>An <strong>oscilloscope</strong> is an instrument that graphs a signal's intensity over time. You'll create a sound oscilloscope that shows volume (loudness) over time.</li>

<div class="box-head">Sound Waves</div>
<p>Sound is created by pressure waves traveling through a material (like air or water). When you hear music, an instrument or speaker (think of a vibrating guitar string, a vibrating drum head, or a vibrating speaker) creates waves of pressure that travel through the air to your eardrum, which transmits the signal through your nerves to your brain. Have you ever heard a sound that was so loud you could feel it? Those were pressure waves that were so big you could sense them with more than just your eardrum!</p>

			In Snap<em>!</em>, you can use a sprite as a pen that draws on the stage. To create an oscilloscope, you will need to use drawing blocks. Here are a few that may come in handy:
			<ul>
<li><img alt="pen down" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/pen-down-full-size.png" title="pen down"/> puts the sprite's pen tip down so it can draw on the stage.</li>
<li><img alt="pen up" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/pen-up-full-size.png" title="pen up"/> picks the sprite's pen tip up so it stops drawing.</li>
<li><img alt="clear" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/clear-full-size.png" title="clear"/> clears all pen drawings from the stage.</li>
<!--<li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0-full-size.png" alt="go to x: (0) y:(0)" title="go to x: (0) y:(0)" /> moves the sprite to the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) position typed in the input slots.</li>-->
<li><img alt="go to x: (0) y:(0)" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0-full-size.png" title="go to x: (0) y:(0)"/> and <img alt="glide (1) secs to x: (0) y:(0)" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/glide.png" title="glide (1) secs to x: (0) y:(0)"/> move the sprite to the (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) position typed in the input slots. (<code>go</code> does it instantly, and <code>glide</code> lets you see the movement.)</li>
</ul>

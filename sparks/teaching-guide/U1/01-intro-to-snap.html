<h2>Lab 1: Introduction to Snap<em>!</em> <a class="anchor" name="top"> </a></h2>
<p>This lab introduces Snap<em>!</em> programming through a fun and simple activity designed to engage students and give them an experience of success with programming right away as they explore various blocks that greet the user in different languages and fancy formatting. Students learn about the Snap<em>!</em> programming language, interface, and terminology (reporter blocks, input parameters) as they change input parameters to observe the impact on outputs and snap blocks together to create more complicated expressions.</p>
<p>In the second page of this lab, students begin saving their work to a Snap<em>!</em> account. Students can create accounts on their own, but ideally you, as their teacher, set up accounts for each student ahead of time and provide each student with a username and password on the first day.</p>

<strong>All expected times in this Teacher Guide are for planning purposes only</strong> and are <strong>not intended to constrain class time spent</strong>. The appropriate time for your students to spend on any activity may vary from these guidelines and may vary from student to student. BJC Sparks labs include optional "If There Is Time" extensions and "Take It Further" challenge exercises for differentiation.

<h3>Activity 1: Say Hello to Snap<em>!</em>.<a class="anchor" name="A1"> </a></h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Materials:</strong> <a href="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/student-pages/U1/L1/01-say-hello-to-snap.html?topic=sparks%2F1-functions-data.topic&amp;course=middle-school-teacher.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment" target="_blank" title="Say Hello to Snap!">Say Hello to Snap<em>!</em></a> student page</li>
<li>
<strong>Prepare:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Take a few minutes to explore the blocks in the Snap<em>!</em> project to understand what they do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Understand that a block is a piece of code that can be run by a computer and it can be run by clicking it.</li>
<li>Understand that reporter blocks are blocks that report outputs.</li>
<li>Understand that block can have inputs, those inputs can change the output, and the output of one block can be used as the input to another.</li>
<li>Explore changing inputs by typing different text into the input slots, by selecting different dropdown menu options, and by dragging other blocks into the input slots. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students explore two blocks that manipulate text strings (5-10 minutes):
							<ul>
<li>
									The block <img alt="say hello to () in ('English')" class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello.png" title="say hello to () in ('English')"/> takes a name and a language as input and reports a greeting to that person in the selected language:
									<img alt="say hello to (Amira) in (English) reporting 'hello, Amira'" class="notabpd" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/say-hello-english-with-inputs-reporting.png" title="say hello to (Amira) in (English) reporting 'hello, Amira'"/>
</li>
<li>
									The block <img alt="fancy ()" class="inline-block" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/fancy.png" title="fancy ()"/> takes text as input and reports the same text with any letters changed to fancy Unicode letters:
									<img alt="" class="notabpd" src="/bjc-r-ita/sparks/img/U1/lab01/fancy-reporting.png" title=""/>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Students then explore nesting the <code>fancy</code> and <code>say hello</code> blocks inside each other and observe how the output of one block becomes the input to the other. (5-10 minutes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In this first hands-on exploration with Snap<em>!</em>, students may hesitate with basics such as clicking a block to make it run, typing into input slots, etc. The simplicity of this project allows for debugging these simple challenges of the absolute beginner so that they are resolved by the time students move on to more complex use of the Snap<em>!</em> interface such as dragging blocks into each other, creating input parameters, and creating and editing blocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<strong>Standards:</strong>
<ul>
<li>None covered in this activity since it focuses on the basics of using Snap<em>!</em>.</li>

<h3>Activity 2: Saving Snap<em>!</em> Projects<a class="anchor" name="A2"> </a></h3>

Projects">Saving Snap<em>!</em> Projects</a> student page</li>
<li>
<strong>Prepare:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you haven't already, <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/sign_up" target="_blank" title="Snap! sign up"><strong>create your own Snap<em>!</em> account</strong></a> and <a href="http://teachers.bjc.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" title="sign up for access to BJC solutions and assessments">sign up for access to BJC solutions and assessments</a>.</li>
<li>Plan for students' Snap<em>!</em> use. This activity lists three options for how to save Snap<em>!</em> projects. The option you direct students to use will depend on your school and district's policies. Visit the <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/teaching-guide/resources/privacy-contracts.html" title="Student Accounts and Privacy">Student Accounts and Privacy page</a> for details behind these options.
							<ul>
<li>The best option for most schools is Option B, which requires you to set up student accounts in bulk well before the first day of class. Directions are on the <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/teaching-guide/resources/privacy-contracts.html" title="Student Accounts and Privacy">Student Accounts and Privacy page</a>.</li>
<li>Option A is listed first as it is the only option that does not involve  student Snap<em>!</em> accounts. If you are not ready for students to set up accounts yet, Option A will let them proceed with their project without losing their work. Students can always import and save their projects later if they make accounts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may find it helpful to review the beginning of the <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/snap-crash-course.html?course=bjc4nyc_teacher.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: Snap! Crash Course">Beauty and Joy of Computing: Snap<em>!</em> Crash Course</a> and perhaps also to familiarize yourself with the structure of the <a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/help/SnapManual.pdf" title="Snap! Reference Manual">Snap<em>!</em> Reference Manual</a>, which is accessible by clicking the Snap<em>!</em> logo in the top left corner of any Snap<em>!</em> window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Save their Snap<em>!</em> project.</li>
<li>If applicable, access or create a Snap<em>!</em> account.</li>
<li>Learn to navigate the Snap<em>!</em> interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Activity Plan:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students save their Snap<em>!</em> project. If applicable, students will also access their Snap<em>!</em> accounts. (5–20 minutes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned in the "Prepare" section above, the best option for most schools will be Option B, which requires you to set up students account in bulk prior to the lab. See the <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/teaching-guide/resources/privacy-contracts.html" title="Student Accounts and Privacy">Student Accounts and Privacy page</a>.</li>
<li>Some students may already have personal Snap<em>!</em> accounts or would prefer to make their own. Encourage personal use of Snap<em>!</em>, but also insist that students use a student account for their school work.</li><li>If students set up Snap<em>!</em> accounts in class using Option C, consider asking students to enter in your (the teacher's) email address instead of their own. One advantage is that all password reset requests will then go to the teacher, instead of a student email that students may also have trouble accessing. Students' school email addresses may also be more short-lived than teacher addresses, so this potentially reduces instances where students lose access to their projects after they leave a school.</li>
<li>Snap<em>!</em> users can change their password at any time using the Cloud menu.</li>
<li>
							Users can tell whether they are logged in by checking the Snap<em>!</em> Cloud menu:
							<ul>
<li>If it says "Logout" and then a user name, then that user is logged in.</li>
<li>If it says "Login..." then no one is logged in.</li>
</ul>
							If students are using shared computers, they should log out of Snap<em>!</em> when they are done. </li>
<li>You can also tell at a glance whether anyone is logged into Snap<em>!</em> because the cloud icon will be filled in (white) when someone is logged in.
						</li>
<li>
							Make note of any questions or difficulties that arise, and please share them with the curriculum developers:

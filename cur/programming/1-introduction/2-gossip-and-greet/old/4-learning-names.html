<h2>Learning Player Names</h2>



<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a <code>greet player</code> script that greets users and <em>remembers their names</em> so that first-timers get a different greeting from return visitors.
        <!--        <div class="sidenote">This project is an introductory example of a cutting edge field in computer science called Machine Learning.</div>  -->

                    Snap the pieces together in a sequence so that:
                    <ol type="a">
<li>The greeter will <code>ask</code> the player for their name.</li>
<li>
<strong>If</strong> the player's name is in the  <var>player list</var>,
                            <ul><li><code>Say</code> "nice to see you again, <em>player name</em>." </li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Otherwise</strong>, when the player isn't on the list,
                            <ul>
<li><code>Say</code> "nice to meet you, <em>player name</em>," and </li>
<li><code>Add</code> the player's name to the <var>player list</var>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Test and debug. Make sure the script works the way you want it to.</li>

<li>
                    Deciding (selecting) which part of an algorithm to run based on a condition is called <strong>selection</strong>.
                    In this project, the decision is made by <code>if-else</code>: <br/>
<img alt="ask(What is your name?) and wait;if((player list) contains(answer)){}else{}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/greet-player-skeleton.png" title="ask(What is your name?) and wait;if((player list) contains(answer)){}else{}" width="350">
</img></li>
<li>
                    The <code>if</code> and <code>if-else</code> blocks are called <strong>conditionals</strong> because they control the code based on a true-or-false <strong>condition</strong> (here, whether the list of players contains this player's name).
                </li>
<li><strong>Sequencing</strong> means that the computer carries out the instructions in the order in which they appear in your code.</li>
<li>The <strong>flow of control</strong> is the order in which instructions are carried out.</li>

                    Add some enhancements to your script. For example:

                        <li>If the guest is new, have the greeter ask "Do you have any pets?" and if they say "yes," then ask them what type of pet they have and store the answer along with the guest's name. <div class="sidenoteBig">Each entry to <var>player list</var> can be a list of <var>name</var> and <var>kind of pet</var> for each guest. </div></li>
                        <li>If the guest is known to the greeter and has a pet, have the greeter say "How's your <em>dog, cat, bird, ...</em>?" getting the kind of pet from the <var>player list</var>.</li>
                    </ol>

<h2>Make It a Game</h2>
<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page,</strong> you'll make your app more like a game. Alonzo will start to move on his own, making it harder to click him, and each time the player clicks on Alonzo, he will become a little lighter. The goal of the game is to click on Alonzo until he disappears.<br/>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>
                	To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever."  And there is a block that does that:<br/>
<img alt="forever" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/forever.png" title="forever"/><br/>
                    Modify your Alonzo script so that it keeps going:<br/>
<img alt="when I am (clicked) {
    next costume
    forever {
        go to (random position)
    }
}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/alonzo-code-too-fast.png" title="when I am (clicked) {
    next costume
    forever {
        go to (random position)
    }
}"/>
<div class="endnote">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you click the red stop sign (<img alt="red stop button" class="button" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" title="red stop button"/>) or stop that script in some other way.</div>
</li>
<li>Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img alt="wait 1 secs" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" title="wait 1 secs"/> block to slow him down. You can increase or reduce the wait time if you like.</li>
</ol>

<div class="takeNote">

<img alt="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When" class="imageLeft" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/hat-block.png" title="a yellow round-topped hat block that says When"/>
<p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img alt="green-flag button" class="button" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks." </p>

<img alt="when (space) key pressed" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" title="when (space) key pressed"/>
<p>Find these blocks in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.</p>
<p>Don't think that <em>every</em> script needs a hat block.  You can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>

<img class="imageRight noshadow" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/ghost-effect-alonzo.png"/>
<ol start="3">
<li>The command <img alt="ghost effect" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" title="ghost effect"/> can control Alonzo's <em>transparency</em> (how much you can see what's behind it on the stage). Drag the block into the center Scripts area, and experiment with different inputs (clicking it again after each change) to see exactly what it does.  At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible?</li>
<li>Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.  Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game play.</li>

					 -->
                    Put another block somewhere in your script to <code>change ghost effect by -5</code> any time Alonzo moves <em>without</em> being clicked. How does this change the game play?
                </li>
<li>Play your game a few times. Adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.</li>
<div class="endnote">You can change the ghost effect value and the wait time to make the game easier or harder.</div>

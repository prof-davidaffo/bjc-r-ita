<h2>Programming Your App</h2>


<p>
<strong>Welcome to <em>BJC!</em></strong>  We're going to jump right in:
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>
          Make sure either you or your partner is logged in to Snap<em>!</em> so
          you can save your work.
        </li>
<li>
<a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/1-introduction/U1L1-ClickAlonzo.xml"><img alt="Click here to load a starter project. Then save it." class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/load-save.png" title="Click here to load a starter project. Then save it."/></a>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="vocabBig">
<ul>
<li>
          The <strong>stage</strong> is the white area at the top right of the
          Snap<em>!</em> window.
        </li>
<li>
          A <strong>sprite</strong> is like an actor on the stage, who can move
          around, and has other skills too.
        </li>
<li>
          A <strong>costume</strong> is a picture that can be worn by a sprite.
        </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
<img alt="Alonzo icon" height="60" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/alonzo.png"/>This is Alonzo, the mascot of our programming language, Snap<em>!</em>.
      You should be seeing him on the <em>stage,</em> the white area in the top
      right corner of the Snap<em>!</em> window. He's an animated character—you
      can move him around the stage by programming.
    </p>
<p>
      Alonzo is actually just a <em>costume:</em> a picture that can be worn by
      a <em>sprite.</em> The sprite is what "knows" how to move
      around.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="3">
<li>

          Program Alonzo to face the other way when clicked.
          <img alt="Alonzo icon" height="60" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/alonzo.png"/><img alt="Alonzo icon flipped around vertical axis" height="60" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/alonzo-flipped-other-way.png"/>
<ol>
<li>
              The project you loaded has two sprite costumes—one facing
              right and the other facing left—so you can use the
              <code>next costume</code> block to make the sprite face the other
              way. Drag blocks into the center Scripts area to build the script
              shown here. (For more support, read the yellow box below.) <br/>
<img alt="when I am (clicked), next costume" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/when-I-am-clicked-next-costume.png" title="when I am (clicked), next costume"/>
<p>
                This is a computer program. It's a very short one, but it'll get
                more interesting soon.
              </p>
<div class="endnote">
<img alt="Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/motion-palette-categories.jpg" title="Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables"/>
<p>
                  You can find blocks in palettes with their matching color:
                  purple for Looks, yellow for Control, blue for Motion, etc.
                </p>
<p>
                  Drag one block underneath another to snap them together. The
                  thin white bar shows where the blocks will snap together if
                  you release the mouse button.
                </p>

</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
              Un-check the "draggable" box under the sprite name input box. This
              will prevent players from accidentally dragging the sprite when
              they click it.<br/>
<img alt="image of snap sprite tabs area with 'Draggable' box un-checked and circled for emphasis" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/snap-center-tabs.png" title="image of snap sprite tabs area with 'Draggable' box un-checked and circled for emphasis"/>
</li>
<li>
              Try it out: click Alonzo a few times and make sure he always turns
              to face the other way. If not, go back and figure out how to fix
              your code.
            </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
          Add the <code>go to</code> block to your script so that Alonzo will
          also move to a random position each time he's clicked.<br/>
<img alt="go to () block with menu open showing 'random position', 'mouse pointer', and 'center'. The mouse pointer is hovering over 'random position'." class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/go-to-menu-open.png" title="go to () block with menu open showing 'random position', 'mouse pointer', and 'center'. The mouse pointer is hovering over 'random position'."/>
<img alt="Alonzo sprite turning around" class="indent noshadow" data-gifffer="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/alonzo-hopping.gif" height="200" title="Alonzo sprite turning around"/>

</li>
<li>
          Check your program: Click on the Alonzo sprite on the white stage in
          the upper right area of the window. If your script works, Alonzo
          should face the other way and move to a random position on the stage
          each time you click him.
        </li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Saving Your Project</h3>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="6">
<li>
          Choose "Save" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu (<img alt="File button" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" style="height: 1.6em" title="File button"/>).
          <div class="endnote">
            Only one partner needs to save now. You'll share the project with
            your partner(s) later in the lab.

<h2>Managing List Data</h2>




<p>Lists are essential to efficient data management. Lists can be counted, added to, removed from, selected from, searched in, and sorted. In this lesson, you will refine your Shopping List App, and you will explore common programming tasks related to lists: indexing, swapping, and sorting.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>
                    Review your "U2L2-ShoppingList" project from <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/1-shopping-list-app.es.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.es.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.es.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment">Shopping List App</a>:
                    <ol>
<div class="sidenote"><code>Contains</code> will be helpful here.</div>
<li>If you didn't write code for the "Search" button, do it now. Clicking the "Search" button should prompt the user for a search term and then tell the user whether that item is already on the list (but not add the item). If you already wrote code for "Search" button, review your code and either try to improve it or help someone else create their own.</li>
<li>Write a script for the "Delete Item" button that removes an item from the list if you haven't already.</li>

<li>
                            Try re-writing your "Add Item" script a different way:
                            <ul>
<img alt="Save Your Work" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-mini.png" title="Save Your Work"/>
<li>either using <code>set</code> and <code>in front of</code></li>
<li>or using the <code>add</code> block</li>
</ul>
<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/> How do these two methods differ?
						</li>
<div class="sidenoteBig"><code>For each</code> and <code>insert</code> will be helpful here.</div>
<li>
                            Perhaps you coded your "Add Item" button to check to see if the item you want to add is already on the list so you don't create duplicates. Either way, create a "Clean Up List" button that removes any duplicate items from the list. Here are some instructions:
                            <ol>
<li>Save this image to your computer: <a href="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/shopping-list-button-clean-up-list.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Clean Up List button" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/shopping-list-button-clean-up-list.png" title="Clean Up List button"/></a></li>
<li>Open and add a new sprite to your U3L1-ShoppingList project, call the sprite "Clean Up", and import the new button image on the Costumes tab for that sprite.</li>
<li>Create a reporter <code>uniques</code> that takes a list as input and reports a list of each unique item in the original list.</li>

<div class="endnote">Reporter blocks output (report) information based on the inputs, but they don't change the values stored in the input variable(s).</div>
<li>Code the "Clean Up List" button to <code>set</code> the <var>shopping list</var> to a list of the unique items in <var>shopping list</var>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<img alt="Save your work" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-now.png" title="Save your work"/>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Using an Index Variable</h3>


<p>Part of what makes lists so powerful is that lists are ordered and each item in the list has an <em>index number</em> that you can use to refer to that particular item. But using an index variable to process a bunch of values is not specific to lists! Creating an index from scratch is fairly common in programming and worth getting comfortable with.</p>
<p>This block says each of the items in a list:<br/><img alt="read through list (list) block definition" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/index-read-list.png" title="read through list (list) block definition"/></p>
<p>The block says all of the letters in a sentence:<br/><a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/3-lists/old/U3L1-IndexVariable.xml"><img alt="spell word (word) block definition" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/index-spell-word.png" title="spell word (word) block definition"/></a></p>
<p>Since there is no <code>for each letter</code> block that indexes strings of characters as if they were in a list, we must create an index variable and increase it by 1 (<em>increment</em> it) each time through the loop.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="2">
<li><img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/> Read through each line of the <code>spell word</code> script above, and discuss how it works.</li>
<li>
                    Modify <a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/3-lists/old/U3L1-IndexVariable.xml">the script above</a> to make the sprite say the following:
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">
                        When writing a script, if you already have a similar script, then you can:
                        <ul>
<li>Either duplicate the existing script and modify it for the new functionality</li>
<li>Or create a more general script that can be used for both purposes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Every other letter in the word</li>
<li>Every third letter</li>
<li>All the letters in reverse order</li>
<li>A range of letters (for example, letters 4-7) using either a <code>repeat until</code> or a <code>repeat</code> block</li>
</ol>
</li>

<h3>Sorting a List</h3>

</div>
<p>There are many different algorithms for sorting. Some are more efficient than others. Speed and memory matters a lot more when sorting with larger datasets. A simple sorting algorithm that works well with small datasets is the <em>selection sort</em> method shown right.</p>
<div class="endnote">
<p>White is the original list. Yellow is the sorted list. Red is the current minimum. Blue is the current item being compared to the current minimum.</p>
<p>The double-headed arrow indicates a swap from one place in the list to another. The single-headed arrow indicates that the item that was there did not have to move.</p>

<li><img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner">Study the <em>selection sort</em> graphic at right. Discuss how this sorting algorithm works. </img></li>

<li>
                    Imagine you already have a <code>lowest of items after?</code> predicate that takes an index number and a list as inputs and outputs (reports) the following:
                    <ul>
<li><code>true</code> if the list item at that index number is less than or equal to all of the items after it </li>
<li><code>false</code> if there is another item that is less than it after it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><img alt="Talk with Another Pair" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" title="Talk with Another Pair"/>Discuss how you could use your <code>swap with</code> and <code>lowest of items after?</code> blocks to build a selection sort script.</li>

<li>Create a <code>lowest of items after?</code> predicate (as described above). Test it with a  several items in a list of numbers.</li>

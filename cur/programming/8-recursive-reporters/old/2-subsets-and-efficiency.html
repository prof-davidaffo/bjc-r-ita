<h2>Subsets and Efficiency</h2>


<p>
      Here is one solution for the <code>subsets</code> block:<br/>
<img alt="subsets(set){if(empty?(set)){report(list{})}else{report(append(subsets(all but first of(set)))(map(item(1) of (set) in front of ()) over(subsets(all but first of(set)))))}}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/8-recursive-reporters/subset-slow.png" title="subsets(set){if(empty?(set)){report(list{})}else{report(append(subsets(all but first of(set)))(map(item(1) of (set) in front of ()) over(subsets(all but first of(set)))))}}"/>
</p>
<p>
      This solution should remind you of the <code>pascal</code> block you have
      seen in
      <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/optional-project-pascals-triangle/2-pascal-efficiency.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F8-recursive-reporters.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment" title="Pascal's Triangle and Efficiency">Unit 8 Lab 3 Page 2: Pascal's Triangle and Efficiency</a>, which makes two recursive calls and adds the results. The
      <code>pascal</code> block makes two recursive calls
      <em>with different inputs</em>. This version of <code>subsets</code> makes
      <em>the same</em> recursive call twice, an inefficiency that can be
      corrected.

<ol>
<li>
          Using a <code>count</code> variable, as you did for the
          <code>pascal</code> block, count how many recursive calls are made to
          find the 64 subsets of a six-element list.
        </li>
<li>
          Figure out how to reduce the number of recursive calls by avoiding
          redundant calls.

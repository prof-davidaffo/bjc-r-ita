<h2>Pascal's Triangle</h2>


<p>In <strong>Pascal's Triangle</strong>, each number is the sum of the two numbers above it. The numbers at the ends of each row are always 1.</p>

<p align="center">
<strong>Row 1:</strong>    1  1<br/>
<strong>Row 2:</strong>    1  2  1<br/>
<strong>Row 3:</strong>    1  3  3  1<br/>
<strong>Row 4:</strong>    1  4  6  4  1<br/>
<strong>Row 5:</strong>    1  5  10  10  5  1<br/>
<strong>Row 6:</strong>    1  6  15  20  15  6  1<br/>			                ︙
        </p>
<p>For example, each 15 in Row 6 is the sum of the 5 and 10 just above it.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Write out Row 7 of Pascal's Triangle.</li>
<li>
                    Write a <code>next row</code> block that takes a row of Pascal's Triangle as its input, and reports the next row as its output:<br/>
<img alt="next row(list{1,4,6,4,1}) reporting {1,5,10,10,5,1}" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/8-recursive-reporters/nextrow.png" title="next row(list{1,4,6,4,1}) reporting {1,5,10,10,5,1}"/>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
        	To refer to a specific number in Pascal's Triangle, you need to know its row and column. Rows are simple; columns are more complicated because of the triangle's orientation. Here is Pascal's Triangle, aligned in columns:<br/>

</p>
<p class="indent">
            1   1<br/>
            1   2   1<br/>
            1   3   3    1<br/>
            1   4   6    4    1<br/>
            1   5  10  10   5   1<br/>
            1   6  15  20  15  6   1
		</p>
<div class="takeNote">By convention (because it turns out to be useful), the columns in Pascal's Triangle are named starting from 0, not 1. For example, the number in row 4, column 1 of Pascal's Triangle is <strong>4</strong>, not 1.</div>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="3">
<li>What number is in row 6, column 2 of Pascal's Triangle?</li>
<li>Two numbers in row 5 are added to produce the number in row 6, column 2. What are their locations?</li>
<li>To determine the number in row 14, column 5 of Pascal's Triangle, you would need to know two numbers from row 13. In which columns in row 13 are those numbers?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Pascal's Triangle counts the number of ways to pick a collection from larger collection.

<div class="sidenoteBig">What are the base cases? The work in earlier problems should help you figure out the recursion. Try more examples if you're not sure.</div>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="6">
<li>Write a <code>pascal</code> block that takes two numbers as input, <var>row</var> and <var>column</var>, and reports the value in that row and column of Pascal's Triangle.
<!--                    <p>If you prefer to solve puzzles without hints, finish the block definition now. Otherwise, turn the page.</p> -->

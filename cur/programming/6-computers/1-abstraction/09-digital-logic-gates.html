<h2>The Digital Domain: Logic Gates</h2>

<div class="learn">
<strong>On this page,</strong> you review three Boolean operators
      (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) and learn how
      they relate to electronic circuitry.
    </div>
<p>
      In a circuit with billions of transistors, or even thousands of
      transistors, hardware designers can't think about each individual
      transistor. Just as programmers use abstraction, hardware architects use
      abstractions, in which a group of transistors and other circuit elements
      are considered as a single thing. What kinds of things? There are
      basically two kinds, one for memory and one for computation.

          Memory is made out of <em>flip-flops.</em> A flip-flop is a circuit
          that has two stable states, on and off. An input signal can tell it to
          turn on, turn off, or change whatever it's state is. Once that
          happens, the flip-flop stays in the new state until it gets another
          signal. It has an output that reflects its state: on if the flip-flop
          is on, off if it's off.
        </p>

<h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
<p>
      The circuits to do computation are more interesting. They compute
      <em>functions,</em> just like reporters in Snap<em>!</em>. Since computers
      do a lot of arithmetic, you might think that the basic circuit functions
      would be addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but that's
      not the case. Of course there <em>are</em> circuits to do those things,
      but they're made out of <em>logic gates:</em> circuits that compute
      <strong>Boolean functions</strong>: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and
      <code>not</code>.
    </p>
<p>
      The reason that Boolean functions are considered more fundamental is that
      their inputs and outputs can be represented with a single wire going into
      or out from the circuit. That's not true about arithmetic functions. If
      you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning 1, and no voltage as meaning
      0, then you have to see that an adder will have <em>three</em> possible
      output values, because 1+1=2, which is neither 0 nor 1. By contrast, if
      you consider a voltage on a wire as meaning True, and no voltage as
      meaning False, then the output from a Boolean function of two inputs can
      still only be True or False, so only one output wire is needed.
    </p>

                In ordinary language, the word "or" can have two slightly
                different meanings. <em>Inclusive or</em> means "at least one of

                need your overcoat. (If it's both raining and cold, you'd still
                wear the coat.) <em>Exclusive or</em> means "this or that,
                but not both": Eat your vegetables <em>or</em> you won't
                get any dessert. (You'd feel cheated if you ate the vegetables
                and still didn't get dessert.) In computer science (as in
                mathematics) the word "or" by itself always means
                inclusive or, as you can see in this truth table. If you mean
                "exclusive or," you have to say that.

<h2>Logic Gates</h2>
<p>
      Inside a computer, Boolean operations are implemented in physical
      circuitry using logic gates. (A single gate implements one of the basic
      functions <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, or <code>not</code>.) Logic
      circuits are often represented with drawings that help engineers see how
      the information will flow through a circuit. For example, the following
      diagram of a logic circuit with two gates represents the Boolean
      expression
      <img alt="A or (A and B)" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/6-computers/(a)or((a)and(b))-booleans.png" title="A or (A and B)"/>. Can you see how?

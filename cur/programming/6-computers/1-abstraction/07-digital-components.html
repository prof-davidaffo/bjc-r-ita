<h2>The Digital Domain: Components</h2>

<div class="learn">
<strong>On this page</strong>, you'll explore the
      <em>parts</em> (components) of the computer hardware.
    </div>
<p>
      For as long as people have been teaching other people about computers,
      they always say "A computer consists of the processor, memory, and
      input/output (I/O) devices."
    </p>
<p>
      In the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge racks of
      equipment that contained each of those three components:<br/>
<img alt="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/6-computers/pdp-10.jpg" title="Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 Processor and Memory" width="400px"/>

</p>
<p>
      These are pictures of a powerful computer from the 1970s. Each of the big
      racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator. Today, a much
      more powerful computer—more speed, more memory—fits inside a cell phone.
    </p>
<p>
      Because today's processors and memory are so small, most of what we see is
      the <strong>input/output (I/O)</strong> devices, like keyboard, mouse,
      screens. <em>Input</em> devices include the keyboard, mouse, and
      microphone. <em>Output</em> devices include the printer, speaker, and (for
      laptop or desktop computers) the display screen. On phones and tablets,
      touchscreens are used for both input and output. Disk drives, optical
      drives (for CDs and DVDs), and the Internet interface are also used for
      both.

<li>
              Mainly for reading email and surfing web pages (but
              <em>not</em> watching many movies).

<li>Mainly for playing online video games.</li>
<li>Mainly for storing your photos and music.</li>
<li>Mainly for streaming online movies.</li>

          Assume you each want the least expensive computer that does a great
          job for your purpose.
          <strong>Research what features of the computer are most important for your
            purpose, choose a computer, and compare notes with the rest of the
            group.</strong>
          Which computer is most expensive? Least expensive? Did you choose a
          laptop or a desktop, and why?

<h2>Abstraction Inside the Computer</h2>
<p>
      In Unit 4, you saw that the Internet software in a computer is arranged in
      several levels of abstraction, with application programs at the highest
      level and transport protocols such as WiFi and Ethernet at the lowest
      level.
    </p>
<p>What's going on inside a computer also has levels of abstraction:</p>

      Different people might draw this diagram slightly differently, so don't
      try to memorize all the levels. But there are two key abstraction barriers
      highlighted in the diagram, and it's important for you to understand
      those.
    </p>
<p>
      You already understand the program abstraction. Above this level of
      abstraction we're dealing with programs, which you've been writing all
      year. Programs start out as ideas in your head; a
      <em>programming language</em> lets you express them in a form that can be
      carried out by a computer. Below this level of abstraction we're dealing
      with hardware, stuff you can touch. The two categories, software and
      hardware, may seem so different that there's nothing to say about how
      they're related. But very shortly you'll learn about the
      <em>stored program architecture</em> that connects the two.
    </p>
<p>
      The digital abstraction is equally important. Above this level are the
      zeros and ones that people always talk about as "the way computers work."
      As we'll see, the real physical situation inside a computer circuit is
      more complicated, and circuit designers work hard to ensure that the
      simple on/off model of a computer circuit works well enough to allow
      error-free computation.
    </p>
<p>
      In the rest of this unit, you'll explore the levels of abstraction
      operating in a computer system.

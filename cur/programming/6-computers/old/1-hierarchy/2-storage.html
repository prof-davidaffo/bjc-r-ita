<h2>Data Storage and Protection</h2>


<div class="learn">
<p><strong>On this page,</strong>...</p>
</div>

<p>All data is stored in sequences of binary (ones and zeros), and how any binary sequence is interpreted depends on how it will be used. Binary sequences are used to represent instructions to the computer and various types of data depending on the context.</p>
<p>Computers store information in binary using <strong>bits</strong> and <strong>bytes</strong>. A bit is a "0" or "1". A byte is eight bits grouped together like 10001001. </p>
<!--<div class="endnote">Bytes have 8 places, so the left-most place is 2<sup>7</sup> (or 128). <!--Practice what you've learned: What is 10001001<sub>2</sub> in base 10?- -></div>-->
<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Binary Sequence</strong>
<p><em>Every</em> kind of information in the computer—whether it is a number, text, list, or an instruction to perform—is stored as a sequence of 0s and 1s (a <strong>binary sequence</strong>). So, for a program to work, the computer needs to be told how to interpret any such sequence of 0s and 1s.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>bit</strong> – a single unit of data that can only have one of two values (such as a 1 or 0)</li>
<li><strong>bit rate</strong> – the amount of data (measured in bits) that can be sent in a specific amount of time</li>
<li><strong>bandwidth</strong> – the transmission capacity of a system (measured by bit rate)</li>
<li><strong>latency</strong> – time between the transmission and the receipt of a message</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As computers become more powerful, they are capable of handling more information. We used to measure computer memory in <em>kilobytes</em>; one kilobyte is 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) bytes, which is about 10<sup>3</sup>, so we call it a "kilo". These days, your computer memory is likely to be measured in <em>megabytes</em>. One megabyte is 2<sup>20</sup> (about 1 million) bytes.</p>
<p>Your hard drive space is likely to be measured in gigabytes, terabytes, or even petabytes. One <em>gigabyte</em> is 2<sup>30</sup> (about 1 billion) bytes, one <em>terabyte</em> is 2<sup>40</sup> (about 1 trillion) bytes, and one <em>petabyte</em> is 2<sup>50</sup> (about 1 quadrillion) bytes.</p>

<h3>Cloud Storage</h3>
<p>Locally (on your computer), the binary sequences that make up data are temporarily stored in RAM and are stored long-term on your hard drive, but they can also be stored in <strong>the cloud</strong>. "The cloud" just means "on the Internet." You have been using the cloud throughout this whole course! All of your Snap<em>!</em> projects are stored in the cloud; they aren't on your local computer. That's why you have to log in to access your projects. Similarly, if you use Google Drive or Dropbox, all of those files are stored in the cloud. And if you use a web-based email service (like Gmail or Yahoo), your emails are stored in the cloud. <p>
            Here's a BJC video about storage for big data from University of California, Berkeley.<br/>

<h3>Data Compression</h3>
<p>
            Here's a BJC video about data compression from University of California, Berkeley.<br/>

<p>
            Data compression is used to store data more compactly, but it can reduce quality. Here are some extreme examples:<br/>
<img alt="BJC logo uncompressed" class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-original.png" title="BJC logo uncompressed"/>
<img alt="BJC logo JPG compressed" class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-compressed.jpg" title="BJC logo JPG compressed"/>
<img alt="BJC logo GIF compressed" class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/6-computers/bjc-logo-compressed.gif" title="BJC logo GIF compressed"/>
<div class="sidenote">JPG is pronounced "jay-peg." According to its creator, GIF is correctly pronounced "jif," like the brand of peanut butter, but it is more commonly pronounced with a hard G, like in the word "gap."</div>
<ul>
<li>The first is a PNG, a lossless compression method. This is how we store the original BJC logo.</li>
<li>The second is a JPG, a lossy compression method. Notice the blurry artifacts around the letters.</li>
<li>The third is a GIF, another lossy compression method. Notice the artifacts in the letter C; the range of colors has been limited significantly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both JPG and GIF are commonly used on the Internet to reduce the amount of time it takes to load each image so that webpages load quickly even on slow connections. The examples above are extremely compressed to show the kinds of artifacts that can occur with each form of lossy compression.</p>
</p>
<div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Lossy vs. Lossless</strong>
<p><strong>Lossless</strong> compression (like PNG) is <em>reversible</em> (there is no loss in quality); you can reconstruct the original data. It works by removing redundant data.</p>
<p><strong>Lossy</strong> compression (like GIF or JPG) is <em>not</em> fully reversible; you can only reconstruct an <em>approximation</em> of the original data. It works by removing irrelevant data (details that people aren't likely to notice).</p>
<p>There are trade-offs with each technique: lossless compression maintains the original data but might not be able to compress the data much or at all; lossy compression often results in a smaller file but may have artifacts (quality issues from the compression).</p>

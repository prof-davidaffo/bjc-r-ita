<h2>The Digital Domain: Components</h2>
<div class="learn">
<strong>On this page</strong> you'll explore the
      <em>parts</em> (components) of the computer hardware.
    </div>
<p>
      For as long as people have been teaching other people about computers,
      they always say "A computer consists of the processor, memory, and
      input/output (I/O) devices."
    </p>
<p>
      In the early days of computers, it was easy to point out the huge racks of
      equipment that contained each of those three components:<br/>

</p>
<p>
      These are pictures of a powerful computer from the 1970s. Each of the big
      racks full of circuitry is about the size of a refrigerator. Today, a much
      more powerful computer—more speed, more memory—fits inside a cell phone.
    </p>
<p>
      Because today's processors and memory are so small, most of what we see is
      the I/O devices, like keyboard, mouse, screens.

<strong>CPU</strong> (Central Processing Unit)<strong>:</strong>
              The "brain" of the computer, the microprocessor chip where
              programs are run. It is one of the most expensive parts of the
              hardware. Its speed is measured in gigahertz (GHz). Modern CPUs
              can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. <br/>

<strong>RAM</strong> (Random Access Memory)<strong>:</strong>
              Computer's high-speed, working memory. It temporarily stores data
              and instructions for programs that run on the computer. Its
              capacity is measured in gigabytes (GB) and its speed is measured
              in megahertz (MHz).<br/>

<strong>Hard Drive:</strong> I/O device. Long term storage memory
              of the computer. Mechanical drives use a mechanical arm to read

              moving parts. Storage capacity is measured in gigabytes (GB).<br/>

<strong>Monitor:</strong> I/O device. Generally, monitors are
              output devices where the computer visually displays information.
              Touch-screens combine the functions of output and input. The size
              of the screen is measured as the diagonal distance between
              opposite corners.

<li>

<li>
                Decide how to treat errors (Will the user try again immediately?
                Will they move on and repeat later? Or will they have no further
                chance?)
              </li>
<li>Decide whether to keep score and, if so, how to do it</li>

          This might be most interesting in a group of four students, each
          having a different purpose for the computer.
        </div>
<li>

          Suppose you want to buy a computer for <em>one</em> of these four
          reasons:<br/>
<ol start="a">
<li>
              Mainly to read email or to visit web pages that aren't full of
              movies, such as newspapers and online stores.
            </li>
<li>Mainly to play online video games.</li>
<li>
              Mainly to preserve a family's collection of photos and music.
            </li>
<li>Mainly to stream online movies.</li>
</ol>
          You want the least expensive computer that does a great job for your
          purpose. Research what features of the computer are most important for
          your purpose, choose a computer, and compare notes with others. Which
          computer is most expensive? Least expensive? Did you choose a laptop
          or a desktop, and why?

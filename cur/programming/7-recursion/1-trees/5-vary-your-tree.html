<h2>Vary Your Tree</h2>
<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page,</strong> you will make experiment freely with the
        <code>tree</code> procedure to see how you can modify the appearance of
        the result.<br/>

          Experiment! Try varying your tree in the following ways:
          <ul>
<li>Change the turn angle.</li>
<li>Change the scale factor.</li>
<li>Change the number of branches at each level.</li>
<li>
              Change the branching <em>structure</em>. For example, trees can
              have branches along the trunk
              <img alt="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top" class="noshadow" height="150" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree-with-five-branches.png" title="tree with two branches at different locations along trunk and three branches at top"/>
              or even a bent trunk
              <img alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" class="noshadow" height="165" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge"/>.
            </li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
          Change the pen thickness between levels, so that the trunk is really
          thick and the leaves are thin.<br/>
<img alt="tree with thick trunk" class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/thicktree.png" title="tree with thick trunk"/>

<li>
          Make a brown trunk and branches and green leaves.<br/>

            You might have found the green leaves harder to debug than the
            varying thickness. If so, what went wrong with drawing the leaves
            green? Why didn't the same problem come up for the thickness?

          Put some randomness in the choice of angles and/or scaling factors.
          Here are some examples:<br/>

          In nature, gravity affects how plants grow. Here is an example of the
          tree fractal that uses a <code>gravity</code> block to weigh down the
          branches roughly the way gravity would. This tree's branching
          structure looks like
          <img alt="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge" height="165" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree-with-bent-trunk.png" title="tree with trunk bending to the right by 5 degrees at each place where branches emerge"/>. The image below shows what happens when we add gravity. Experiment
          with this idea or work on whatever alternative you find interesting
          and beautiful.<br/>

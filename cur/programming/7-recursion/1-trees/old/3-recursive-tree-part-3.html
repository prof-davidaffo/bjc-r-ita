<h2>Recursive Tree, Part 3</h2>
<p>
      Last time, we tried to generalize this pattern:<br/>
<img alt="tree2" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree2.png"/>
          
      <img alt="tree3" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree3.png"/>
          
      <img alt="tree4" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/old/tree4.png"/><br/>
      by making a single block that took the level number as an
      <em>input, </em>instead of as part of the block name:<br/>
<img alt="tree script first version" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree-nobase.png"/>
</p>
<p>
      Unfortunately, it did not work:<br/>
<img alt="picture of failing tree" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/treebug.gif"/>
</p>
<p>
      The sprite draws smaller and smaller left branches, finally just spinning
      around in one place, without ever drawing a right branch.
    </p>
<p>
      What went wrong? The problem is that the original numbered
      <code>tree</code> scripts <em>aren't </em>all the same. The first one,
      <code>tree1</code>, is different; it just draws a trunk, without any
      branches:<br/>
<img alt="tree1 script" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree1.png"/>
</p>
<p>
      So our all-in-one <code>tree</code> block has to do something different
      from what's now in the script for the case <code>levels=1</code>.<br/>
<img alt="correct tree script" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree.png"/>
</p>
<p>
      With this change, we can draw trees of any complexity. Here's a level-9
      tree:<br/>
<img alt="picture of tree on stage" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/7-recursion/tree-level9.jpg"/>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>

<li>
          The amount of time required to draw the tree goes up very quickly with
          the number of levels, so we don't recommend trying 20 levels. Try
          timing level 8 through level 12.
        </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="takeNote">
      This general code pattern, with a simple <em>base case</em> that doesn't
      call the block itself, is typical of recursion. (<em>Recursion </em>is the
      name for a block that calls itself in its script.) There's a base case and
      a recursive case.

<h2>Checking for Leap Years</h2>

<p>
      Some years in our (Gregorian) calendar are "leap years." In a leap year,
      February has a 29th day and the year overall has 366. Leap years let the
      calendar adjust for the fact that it takes the earth takes slightly
      <em>over</em> 365 days to revolve around the sun. The fact that it is
      approximately 365.25 days should mean that leap year should come every
      fourth year.
    </p>
<p>
      But, things are a bit more complicated than that because one revolution
      around the sun is <em>almost</em> but not quite 365.25 years, so leap
      years come slightly less often than once every four years. To figure out
      if a year (say, 1999) is a leap year, you need to test whether it is
      divisible evenly — that is, if there is no remainder after the
      division — by three different values.
    </p>
<div class="takeNote">
<p>A calendar year is a leap year if</p>
<ul>
<li>it can be divided evenly by 4,</li>
<li>
<em>unless</em> it can also be divided evenly by 100, in which case it
          is <em>not</em> a leap year,
        </li>
<li>
          except if it is <em>also</em> divisible by 400, in which case it
          <em>is</em> a leap year.
        </li>
</ul>

      </p>
</div>
<p>
      So, the year 2000 was a leap year (divisible evenly by 400, 100, and
      4),1900 was not (divisible evenly by 100 and 4 but not by 400), 2012 was
      (divisible evenly by 4 but neither 100 nor 400), and 2015 wasn't (not
      divisible by 4).

          Consider the block sets below: they all say "leap year" if the
          <code>year</code> variable is a leap year and "normal year" otherwise.
          That is, they all work correctly, without any bugs. (The scripts are
          available in
          <a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/conditionals/dates/is-leap-year.xml">this <span class="snap">snap</span> program</a>).

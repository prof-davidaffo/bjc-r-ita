<h2>Making a Kaleidoscope</h2>

<p>
<a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/1-introduction/kaleidoscope.xml">Here is a drawing program</a>
      to explore. The main part of it is:
    </p>
<div class="sidenote">
      The <em>hat</em> shaped blocks, which can be used only at the top of a
      script, tell when to run that script.
    </div>
<a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/1-introduction/kaleidoscope.xml"><img alt="Kaleidoscope Script" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/follow-that-mouse-when-space.png"/></a>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Click on the link above to open the template code.</li>
<li>
          You've used part of this script before and know what it does. The new
          part is <code>when space key pressed</code>. Experiment to see what
          that does.
        </li>
<li>
          Now, while you are moving your mouse over the stage, use the
          <strong>d</strong>, <strong>u</strong>, and <strong>c</strong> keys to
          control what gets drawn. Can you get the sprite to write your name?
        </li>
<li>
          Now you get to invent a script on your own to make a (kind of)
          kaleidoscope, like this:<br/>
<div class="sidenote">
            One sprite is following the mouse. Three other sprites are
            reflecting the movement of that sprite in slightly different ways.
          </div>
<img alt="Kaleidoscope Activity" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/1-introduction/topic1-kaleidoscope.gif"/><br/>
          Some useful information:
          <ul>
<li>
              You need four sprites. One way to create the others is to
              <em>duplicate</em> the one you have. Right-click the sprite-button
              in the sprite corral, and select "duplicate" from the
              <em>context menu</em> that appears. Each duplicated sprite will
              have the same scripts as the original, which is why duplication is
              easier than creating new sprites from scratch.
            </li>
<li>
              Click on any sprite in the corral to see its script. They will all
              be the same at first but you will modify three of them to change
              the color and create the reflections.
            </li>
<li>
              To change the color, click the color input in that sprite's
              <img alt="Set Pen to Color X Block" class="block" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/set-pen-color.png"/>
              block, choose whatever color you like, and then click on the block
              itself (to run the block and actually set the color).
            </li>
<li>
              To change how they move, you will need to modify the
              <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> inputs in each sprite's
              <img alt="go to x: () y: ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png" title="go to x: () y: ()"/>
              block using
              <img alt="() + ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/plus.png" title="() + ()"/>
              or
              <img alt="() - ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/minus.png" title="() - ()"/>.
            </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div class="saveAs">
<span class="text">"U2-Kaleidoscope"</span><img alt="Save your work as U2-Kaleidoscope" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-this-as.png" title="Save your work as U2-Kaleidoscope"/>

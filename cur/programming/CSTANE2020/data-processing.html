                            You may need to use <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, or <code>combine</code> to answer your question. Students would have already learned about each one separately:
                            <ul>
<li><strong><code>Map</code> transforms every element of a data set</strong> (such as doubling every element in a list, or extracting the parent’s email from every student record)</li>
<li><strong><code>Keep</code> filters a data set</strong> (such as keeping only the positive numbers from a list, or keeping only students who signed up for band from a database of all students)</li>
<li><strong><code>Combine</code> combines or compares data in some way</strong> (such as: adding up a list of numbers, i.e., combining the elements with the addition block, which takes two inputs; or finding the student who has the highest GPA, i.e., comparing all the elements with a block that finds the maximum of two inputs) </li>
</ul>
<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-hofs-review" title="Here is a quick review of higher order functions.">Here are examples of each of these higher order functions.</a>
<div class="collapse" id="hint-hofs-review">
<ul>
<li>
<code>Map</code> performs a function on every item of a list and reports the list of changed items.<br/>
<img alt="map (( )-(1)) over (list (96) (-100) (4.7)) reporting" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/map-example-1.png" title="map (( )-(1)) over (list (96) (-100) (4.7)) reporting"/>
</li>
<li>
<code>Keep</code> uses a predicate function (a true/false question) to check every item in a list and reports the items that make the predicate true.<br/>
<img alt="keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/keep-items-(last-letter-h)-reporting.png"/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<code>Combine</code> uses a combining function (a function with two inputs) to report the results of combining all the items in a list using that function.<br/>
<img alt="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/combine-simple-example.png" title="combine (list {0, 1, 2}) with (()+()) reporting 3">

<div class="collapse" id="hint-questions">
<ul>
<li>What's the average MPG that cars in this database get in the city? (You'd need an <code>average</code> block.)</li>
<li>What's the year of the oldest car in this dataset? (You'd need a <code>minimum</code> block.)</li>
<li>How many cars in this dataset have manual transmission? </li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that all of these examples only require data from <em>one column</em>. Students are offered extension activities if they want to ask a question that requires looking at another column (for example, "What's the <em>model</em> of the car with the highest <em>MPG</em>?").</p>

<h3>Analyzing Data</h3>
<p>
<div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.D.4</div>
            You can ask questions about a specific subset of your data by <em>filtering</em> the data using <code>keep</code>. Filtering is a powerful technique for finding information and recognizing patterns in data. For example, filtering can help you answer questions like "What is the average city MPG <em>for just the Subarus</em> in this dataset?"<br/>
<img alt="average of (column (9) of table (keep items (field (14) of record 'empty list input slot' = Subaru) from (data of table (cars))) reporting 19.704..." class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/average-mpg-of-subarus-reporting.png" title="average of (column (9) of table (keep items (field (14) of record 'empty list input slot' = Subaru) from (data of table (cars))) reporting 19.704..."/><br/>
            Column 14 is the "Make" of the vehicle, so we <code>keep</code> all the records from <var>cars</var> for which the 14<sup>th</sup> field is "Subaru." Then, we take column 9 of those records (the "City MPG") and find their average.
        </p>
<div class="endnote">
<p>Notice that there are many digits in the answer above.  How many digits are given in the table for each car's MPG?  An important rule in data science is not to claim more precision in a result than is warranted by the given data, so this answer should be rounded to 19.</p>
</div>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="6">
<li><img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/> Determine one question you can answer by <strong>looking at a single column of a <em>portion</em> </strong> of your data set, and then build code to answer that question.</li>

<li>What's the year of the oldest <em>Honda</em> in this dataset? (You'd need <code>minimum</code>.)</li>
<li>How many <em>2009</em> cars in this dataset have manual transmission? </li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the column you use to filter the data (such as year) doesn't have to be the column you are asking about (such as transmission).</p>

</div>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
            Sometimes, you want to keep a subset of your data (such as "Which cars were made in 2010?"), but other times, you just want one item that matches your requirement, often because what you really want to know is whether <em>any</em> items match, and as soon as you find one, the answer is "yes" (such as "Were any electric cars made in 2010?"). Snap<em>!</em> has a higher order function <img alt="find first item () in 'list input slot'" class="inline nopadtb" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/find-first.png" title="find first item () in 'list input slot'"/> that works similarly to <code>keep</code>, but it reports only the first item that's found, so it can be faster.
        </p>
<div class="endnote">
<p><code>Find first</code> is a higher order function like <code>keep</code>, <code>map</code>, and <code>combine</code>, because it takes a function (a predicate) as input. (<code>Find first</code> is like <code>item (1) of (keep)</code>.)</p>

<h2>Military Technology in Everyday Life</h2>


<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn how military technologies
        end up being used for civilian purposes and consider the ethics of
        working on military technologies.
      </p>
</div>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>
          Look up the following:
          <ol>
<li>Which came first, nuclear power plants or nuclear weapons?</li>
<li>Who set up the GPS satellite network, and why?</li>
<li>Who paid for the development of the Internet, and why?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
      Many technologies are developed for military purposes and turn out also to
      be useful for the rest of us.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="2">
<li>
          Brainstorm as big a list as you can of
          <strong>dual-use technologies</strong>. (It doesn't count as dual-use
          if a technology developed for everyone to use, such as the telephone,
          is useful to the military in the same way that it's useful to anyone.)

          Mary Golda Ross (1908–2008) was a ground-breaking Native American
          engineer and the first female employed by Lockheed, an American
          aerospace technology corporation. Ross was passionate about educating
          women and Native Americans and spent over ten years teaching while
          earning her Master’s degree in mathematics during the summer. Lockheed
          hired her as a mathematician in 1942. During her thirty-plus years
          there, Ross contributed to cutting-edge aerospace designs including
          concepts for interplanetary space travel, crewed and uncrewed
          Earth-orbiting flights, and orbiting satellites.

<strong>1. General Moral Imperatives</strong>
<p>As an ACM member I will...</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Contribute to society and human well-being.</strong></p>
<p>
        This principle concerning the quality of life of all people affirms an
        obligation to protect fundamental human rights and to respect the
        diversity of all cultures. An essential aim of computing professionals
        is to minimize negative consequences of computing systems, including
        threats to health and safety. When designing or implementing systems,
        computing professionals must attempt to ensure that the products of
        their efforts will be used in socially responsible ways, will meet
        social needs, and will avoid harmful effects to health and welfare...
      </p>
<p><strong>1.2 Avoid harm to others.</strong></p>
<p>
        "Harm" means injury or negative consequences, such as undesirable loss
        of information, loss of property, property damage, or unwanted
        environmental impacts. This principle prohibits use of computing
        technology in ways that result in harm to any of the following: users,
        the general public, employees, employers. Harmful actions include
        intentional destruction or modification of files and programs leading to
        serious loss of resources or unnecessary expenditure of human resources
        such as the time and effort required to purge systems of "computer
        viruses." ...

<li>
          Which do you think is more harmful to others: deleting their computer
          files, or killing them? Which of these does the ACM consider more
          harmful?
        </li>
<li>
          Research and discuss: Is it ethical to work on weapons? How do some
          ACM members justify such work? Does it matter if the work is on a

<h2>Creating a Computer Player</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the
        human player.
      </p>
</div>
<p>
      The game currently allows two human players to take turns playing. But you
      don't really need a computer to keep track of moves for two human players.
      We want the human player to take turns with a computer player that will
      move automatically. To simplify the project, we'll assume that the human
      player will always move first (playing X) and that the computer is playing
      O.
    </p>
<h3>At first, have the computer move randomly</h3>
<p>
      For now, you'll create a computer player that moves to
      <em>random</em> positions on the board. (It won't be a very good player,
      but you'll fix that once the structure of the code for the computer's move
      is in place.) Once the program decides where it wants to move, you'll use
      <code>broadcast</code> to send a message to tell the clone with the
      matching <var>position number</var> to record a move. (For the human
      player, <code>when I am clicked</code> serves this purpose, but the
      computer's moves aren't prompted by the user clicking a square.)
    </p>
<div class="endnote">
      Recall that clones are temporary copies of a sprite. You learned about
      them in
      <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/3-lists/1-abstraction/5-building-tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment#clones" title="Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 5: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board">Unit 3 Lab 1 Page 5: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</a>.
    </div>
<p>
<img alt="broadcast" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/broadcast.png" title="broadcast"/>
<img alt="when I receive" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/when-i-receive.png" title="when I receive"/>
<img alt="message" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/message.png" title="message"/>
</p>
<p>
<code>Broadcast</code> sends out a message to all the sprites in the
      project. Any scripts that start with <code>when I receive</code> and have
      a matching message in the input slot will run.
    </p>
<p>
      The <code>message</code> reporter reports the most recent message sent
      out.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>If it isn't open already, open your U5-TicTacToe project.</li>
<li>
          Find the script that starts <code>when I am clicked</code>. That
          script handles a move by the human player. Now start a new script next
          to it:<br/>
<img alt="when I receive (any message) : if (message) = (square number) [nothing in script slot yet]" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/when-receive.png" title="when I receive (any message) : if (message) = (square number) [nothing in script slot yet]"/>
</li>
<li>
          What's going to go in that slot? What it needs to do is make a move on
          behalf of the computer. But that's just like making a move on behalf
          of a human player, except that a different event makes it happen. So
          you're going to be tempted to copy and paste all the code from the
          "clicked" script to the "receive" script, but don't do that. Instead,
          make a block
          <img alt="move in this square (command block)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/move-here.png" title="move in this square (command block)"/>
          and drag everything inside the <code>if</code> that surrounds the
          move-here code into the new block. So you now have (depending on
          exactly how you wrote the "clicked" script) something like this:<br/>
<img alt="when I am clicked : if (costume #) = 1" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/when-clicked.png" title="when I am clicked : if (costume #) = 1"/>   
          <img alt="when I receive (any message) : if (message) = (square number)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/when-receive-mov.png" title="when I receive (any message) : if (message) = (square number)"/>

<div class="collapse" id="hint-how-vacant">
              Look in <var>board</var>.
            </div>
</div>
          In the <code>move in this square</code> block, after your code for
          Player X's turn, randomly pick a vacant square and use
          <code>broadcast</code> with that square number as the message. (The
          computer will move in the corresponding square, if your
          <code>when I receive</code> script is working.)
        </li>
<div class="narrower">
          If your computer player uses the wrong costume when it plays in the
          last square, it's because the parent sprite has the same
          <var>position number</var>. Revise <code>make board</code>, and ensure
          that the parent's position number isn't 1-9 so that it doesn't
          conflict with a clone.

<h3>Now give the computer a simple strategy</h3>
<p>
      Instead of having the computer move at random, you will start to give the
      computer some strategy. Unlike people, all squares on the tic-tac-toe
      board are <em>not</em> created equal. Playing in the center (position 5)
      or on a corner (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is better than playing on an edge
      (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8).<br/>

          Why is playing in the center or a corner better than an edge? Develop
          a short, logical, and convincing explanation. Compare your explanation

          block that reports the best position on the board that is not yet
          filled. Use it as input to your <code>broadcast</code> instruction in
          place of <code>random</code>.

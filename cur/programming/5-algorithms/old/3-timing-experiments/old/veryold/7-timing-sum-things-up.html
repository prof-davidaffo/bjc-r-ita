<h2>Timing Sum-thing's Up</h2>

<p>
      We will now see an example where the runtime of an algorithm really does
      make a difference. Remember the game you played with young Gauss at the
      beginning of lab? We will implement the game in
      <span class="snap">snap</span>.
    </p>

<p>
<a href="">Earlier in the lab</a>, you made a block that returned the sum
      of numbers between 1 and <code>max</code>. In the "Variables" palette, you
      will see two blocks:
    </p>

<img alt="add all numbers in list" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/list/add-numbers-to-list-blocks.png" title="add all numbers in list"/>
<p>
      The first block sums up the numbers in the <code>numbers</code> list the
      normal, "non-Gauss" way: walking through the list and adding the numbers
      one by one. The second block sums up the numbers the "Gauss" way: using
      the formula
      <span class="katex-block">(N + 1) \times (N ÷ 2)</span>
      where, in this case, <em>N</em> is the same as <code>max</code>. (<a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/5-algorithms/2-algorithm-complexity/2-competing-with-young-gauss.html">How did we get this formula?</a>)
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>Complete the bodies of these blocks.</li>
<li>
          Once you are done, drag the first block (the "non-Gauss" block) onto
          the stage and place it immediately after the
          <code>add all numbers between 1 and max</code> block.
        </li>
<li>
          Then, move the <code>reset timer</code> block <em>after</em> the
          <code>add all numbers between 1 and max</code> block, since we only
          need to time how long the "non-Gauss" block takes to sum the numbers
          in the <code>numbers</code> list.
        </li>
<li>
          Now, run the script with <code>max</code> set to 10. Again, run it a
          few times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to sum
          the numbers up.
        </li>
<li>
          Repeat the experiment with <code>max</code> set to:
          <ul>
<li>20</li>
<li>40</li>
<li>100</li>
<li>1000</li>
</ul>
</li>

          "non-Gauss" block have: constant, linear, or neither? Why do you think
          this is the case?
        </li>
<li>
          Replace the "non-Gauss" block with the "Gauss" block and run the
          script once more with <code>max</code> set to 10. Again, run it a few
          times to get an idea of the average time the computer takes to sum the
          numbers up.

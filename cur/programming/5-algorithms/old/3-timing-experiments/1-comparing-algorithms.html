<strong>In this lab,</strong> you will learn that some ways to solve a
        problem are faster than others.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>On this page,</strong> you will compare two algorithms for
        adding the numbers from 1 to an input number (as shown below).<br/>

        Morgan and Jasmine are creating algorithms that take a positive integer
        as input and report the sum of all integers from 1 to the input number,
        like this: <br/>
<img alt="sum from 1 to (13) reporting 91" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/sum-from-1-to-13-reporting.png" title="sum from 1 to (13) reporting 91"/><br/>
        Their two different approaches always give the same outputs for the same
        inputs. Morgan and Jasmine are discussing their different approaches.

<div>
<span>Morgan: </span> I made two new blocks. First, I created a reporter
        to list of all the integers between and including two integers, and then
        I used <code>combine</code> to add up the list.

For example:<br />
                    <div class="sidenote">Read this out loud as "combine the elements of  the list {5, 6, 2, 3} with addition."</div>

                <div class="sidenoteBig"><code>Combine</code> is a <em>higher order function</em>. This means that it is a function that takes a function as input. You've seen some higher order functions already: <code>keep</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/3-predicates/5-keeping-list-items.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Keeping Items from a List">Unit 2 Lab 3</a>) and <code>map</code> (in <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/3-lists/2-contact-list/5-mapping-over-list.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment" title="Transforming Every List Item">Unit 3 Lab 1</a>).</div>
                    <p>You choose the operation, and <code>combine</code> performs that operation by <em>combining</em> all the items in the input list and then reports the result.</p>
                    <p>Notice that the function used to <em>combine</em> the list items always has two blank input slots. Both <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> only need one blank in their input function, but with <code>combine</code>, two are required.</p>

                    Unlike <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code>, <code>combine</code> is mostly used with one of <em>only these six</em> functions:<br />

                    Among blocks you might write yourself, there are only two likely candidates:<br />

                    <div id="hint-3" class="collapse">
                    	The function has to be <em>associative</em>, meaning that it doesn't matter what order you group the items in; (7&thinsp;+&thinsp;8)&thinsp;+&thinsp;1 is the same as 7&thinsp;+&thinsp;(8&thinsp;+&thinsp;1) (work it out yourself), but (7&thinsp;−&thinsp;8)&thinsp;−&thinsp;1 is different from 7&thinsp;−&thinsp;(8&thinsp;−&thinsp;1).

<div><span>Morgan: </span> But the answer is 91.</div>
<div>
<span>Jasmine: </span> Right. I added each number in twice, so the

<div>
<span>Morgan: </span> Oh, and if you wanted to add the numbers from 1 to
        50, you'd multiply 50 and 51 and divide by 2 to get
        <em>(Morgan calculates)</em> 1275.

<div>
<span>Jasmine:</span> <em>(smiling)</em> So in general to add the
        numbers between 1 and some number, <em>n</em>, you multiply the input
        number by one more than the input number and then you divide the result

              When adding the numbers from 1 to 100, how many arithmetic

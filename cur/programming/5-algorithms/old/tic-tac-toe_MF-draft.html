<h2>Creating a Computer Player</h2>
<div class="learn">
<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player <em>randomly</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>The game currently allows two human players to take turns playing. We need to make a way for the human player to take turns with a computer player that will take turns automatically. To simplify the project, we'll assume that the human player will always move first (playing X), and so the computer is playing O.</p>
<p>
            First, we'll create two abstractions (<code>make player move</code> and <code>check for wins and ties</code>) using the code you already have so that:
            <ol type="a">
<li>You can read your code more easily,</li>
<li>You can use these blocks to make the moves for both the human <em>and</em> the computer players, and</li>
<li>You can use them to check for wins and ties for both players too.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>
                    If you haven’t already, consolidate the code that implements each player's move into one abstraction. Create a <code>make player move</code> block, and use it to simplify your <code>when I am clicked</code> script.<br/>
<div class="sidenote">If you have already built blocks like <code>make player move</code> and <code>check for wins and ties</code>, you don't have to change their names, but you should look inside and	remember how they work.</div>

</img></li>
<li>
                    If you haven’t already, create a <code>check for wins and ties</code> block, and use it to simplify your code too.<br/>

</img></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>For now, we'll create a computer player that moves to random positions on the board. Once the program decides where it wants to move, we'll use <code>broadcast</code> to send a <code>message</code> to tell the correct clone what to do.</p>
<div class="endnote">Recall that clones are temporary copies of a sprite. You learned about them in <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/3-lists/1-abstraction/5-building-tic-tac-toe.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment#clones" title="Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 4: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board">Unit 2 Lab 4 Page 4: Building a Tic-Tac-Toe Board</a>.</div>

<p><code>Broadcast</code> sends out a message to all the scripts in the project. Any scripts that start with <code>when I receive</code> and have a matching message in the input slot will run.</p>

<li>Then create a <code>when I receive</code> script that will accept <var>any message</var> as input. If the <var>position number</var> for the clone matches the <code>message</code>, use the abstractions you just created to make the computer move in the correct clone's space and check for a win or a tie.</li>

<li>We will fix the bug on the next page, but for now, you could create a <code>next move for computer</code> block and use it as the input for your <code>broadcast</code> instruction in place of <code>random</code>.

<h1>Lab name: Tic-Tac-Toe with a Strategic Computer Player</h1>
<h2>Developing a Gameplay Strategy</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p><strong>In this lab</strong>, you'll make the computer play against the human player <em>strategically</em>.</p>
<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll define the strategy that the computer will use by investigating the strategies that humans use.</p>
</div>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Temporarily remove the buggy <code>broadcast</code> block from your <code>when I am clicked</code> script so it's a human vs. human player game again. Play a couple games of Tic-Tac-Toe with your partner, and pay attention to the strategy (or strategies) you use.</li>
<li>Discuss your strategy with your partner, and write out a list if/then rules that you both use to play (like, "<em>if</em> such-and-such is the case, <em>then</em> play here").</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The stategy rules for Tic-Tac-Toe have different degrees of priority. For example, the most important rule is "if I can win on this turn, then play in the winning square."</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="3">
<li>What's the second most important rule?</li>
<li>
<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner">

<div class="endnote">You don't have to program it yet. Just talk about what you could do.</div>
</img></img></img></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>The final rule is "if no other rule applies, play in some free square." But not all squares are equally good, so you should program a refinement: "Play in the center (square 5), if it's free; or a corner (squares 1, 3, 7, and 9) as second choice; or an edge (2, 4, 6, 8) as last resort."</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>
<img alt="Talk with Another Pair" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" title="Talk with Another Pair">
                    Why is the center the best choice? Why is a corner second best? You should have a really short, logical, convincing explanation. Compare your explanation with those of other students.<br/>
</img></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="endnote">These three rules (if you can win on this move, do so; if the other player can win on their next move, block them; and otherwise just pick the best empty square) are part of most human Tic-Tac-Toe strategies. But the best players develop additional rules that come after the first two but before the last. You can explore some of these rules in the Take It Further problems at the end of the lab.</div>

<h2>Choosing the Best Move</h2>
<div class="learn">
<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you'll implement the Tic-Tac-Toe strategy rules to make the computer play strategically.</p>
</div>
<p>First, you'll replace the <code>broadcast</code> block and set up a <code>next move for computer</code> block. You will broadcast to all the clones the position (1-9) where the computer (player O) should move, and like before, only the sprite with the matching <var>position number</var> will make the move.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Replace the <code>broadcast</code> block you removed from your <code>when I am clicked</code> script.</li>
<li>If you haven’t already, make a <img alt="next move for computer" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/next-move.png" title="next move for computer"/> block, and use it as the input to <code>broadcast</code> instead of <code>random</code>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
        	Next, you'll implement the structure of the three strategy rules:
            <ul>
<li>Rule 1: If I (the computer) can win; do so.</li>
<li>Rule 2: If my opponent (the human) can win; block them.</li>
<li>Final rule: Otherwise, just pick the best empty square.'</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="3">
<li>
                    Create these new blocks for implementing the strategy rules. You'll write code for them soon.<br>

<div class="forYouToDo">

<li>The <code>won?</code> block works by looking for a triple in which all three slots are O, or all three slots are X.

                        It's like <code>keep</code>, except that it reports just one matching item, rather than a list of all matching items.  (If there are no matching items, it reports an empty list.)
                        <p>
                            Also, you may find it helpful to invent these blocks:<br/>

<li>
                    Program more rules to make the computer a better player.  This will involve looking more than one move ahead.  There are various ways to do it, and what follows is just one suggestion.
                    <ol type="a">
<li>
                            It's not good enough just to look for a winning move for yourself two moves from now. If you can see such a move, so can your opponent, who'll move to block you. So what you have to find is a <em>fork: </em>two triples in which you have one appearance and your opponent has none, and which have a free square in common. This is much easier to see with a picture:
                            <p><img alt="board with fork" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/hof/fork.png" title="board with fork"/></p>
<p>X opened the game with the standard opening move, in the center. O  responded very badly, on the top edge, and is therefore about to lose the game. X played in the top left corner. O had to respond in the bottom right corner in order to block an immediate win for X. It's X's turn. There is no winning combination with two Xs, nor with two Os. But X can find <em>two</em> winning combinations, the ones marked with the red lines, both of which have one X and two free squares, <em>with one of the free squares in common. </em>In the picture, the common square is 4, the left edge square, and so that's where X should move.</p>
</li>
<li>Trick question to make sure you're paying attention: Wouldn't it be better to find a fork in which X has <em>two</em> apperances in each triple? Discuss this with your partner if you don't have a good answer.</li>
<li>The point of the fork is that if X moves in square 4, then X has two winning combinations for next time. It's O's turn, but O can block only one of the two wins, and so X fills out the remaining winning combination two moves from now. For example, if O moves in square 6 to block the center row, then X moves in square 7 to win in the left column. Conversely, if O moves in 7, then X moves in 6 and wins.</li>
<li>Find all the triples (that is, report a <em>list of triples</em>) in which the computer has one square, and the other two are empty and store in a variable called <var>singles</var>.</li>
<div class="sidenoteBig">"Atom" is a technical term for a value that isn't a list. A list contains a bunch of items, just as a molecule contains a bunch of atoms.</div>
<li>
                            Make one big list of all the letters and numbers from the triples:<br/>
<img alt="script variable(atoms); set (atoms) to (combine with(append()()) items of (singles))" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/hof/ttt-flatten.png" title="script variable(atoms); set (atoms) to (combine with(append()()) items of (singles))"><br/>
                            You don't have the <code>append</code> block in your palette, but it's in one of the Snap<em>!</em> libraries. Click on the file menu icon, and choose "Libraries...", then choose "List utilities" from the new menu that appears.
                        </img></li>
<div class="sidenoteBig">
                            You wrote a <code>duplicates in</code> block in 
                            <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/5-algorithms/1-searching-lists/7-comparing-search-algorithms.html" title="List Processing Algorithms">Unit 5 Lab 1</a>.
                        </div>
<li>Now find a number that appears more than once in <code>atoms</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<img alt="Tough Stuff" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" title="Tough Stuff">
<li>Here's a completely different approach to Tic-Tac-Toe: Make a permanent list of <em>key-value pairs</em> in which the key (the first item of a pair) is a possible state of the board <img alt="board" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/board.png" title="board"/> and the value (the second item) is a number saying where to move next. This would be really messy if you had to account for every possible board position, but you only need to consider the ones in which neither player has won yet. Also, you can make a special case for the computer's first move. If the computer is playing O, there are really only three ways X can have made the first move: the center, a corner, or an edge. If X moved in a corner, <em>renumber</em> the board so that the corner where X moved becomes 1, and similarly for an edge move. (This will take some effort in the program; you can't just wish away the fact that X may have moved in square 3, say, rather than 1.) Then the computer can move just by looking for the current board situation in the list.</li>
<img alt="Tough Stuff" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" title="Tough Stuff">
<img alt="Tough Stuff" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" title="Tough Stuff">
<li>Here's yet a third approach: Have the same key-value list, but have it start out empty. If the computer moves next and the current board situation isn't in the key-value list, make a <em>random</em> move, keep a record of it, and see what happens. If the program loses a game, it should note that its last move wasn't a good one, and next time that same board position comes up, try a different random move. This <em>learning </em>version is complicated to write, but it's much more like a serious artificial intelligence program, and it's not limited to Tic-Tac-Toe.  You can use the same algorithm to play any strategy game. Once you've written the program, you can let it play <em>against itself</em> a few thousand times and save the resulting key-value list. </li>

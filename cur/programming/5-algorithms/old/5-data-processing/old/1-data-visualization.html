<h2>Data Visualization</h2>

<p>
      Seeing data presented graphically can give rise to new understandings more
      easily than trying to make sense of a long list of numbers.
    </p>
<p>
      If you did Lab 2: Graphing Data and Functions, you've built your own app
      to plot pairs of numbers as points on the stage. If you like, you can use
      that one instead of the one we present below.

          block that takes a list of pairs of numbers as its input and plots
          them on the stage, automatically scaling so that they all fit.

          you analyzed GPS data for Big Burger and changed the way you looked at
          the data to find clusters within it. Reopen your U4L2-GPSData project,
          and import the plot.xml library. Use <code>plot</code> to see the
          values.

          How can you visualize just one of the three Big Burger clusters?

<li>
          For each cluster, find and plot the average of all the longitudes and
          latitudes of the cluster. Your work and blocks from

          Think of some ways data could be especially difficult to analyze
          through graphing.

<h2>Review Your Tic-Tac-Toe Project</h2>

<strong>In this lab</strong>, you'll extend your
        <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/3-lists/3-tic-tac-toe/1-find-ties.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment" title="Tic-Tac-Toe program">Tic-Tac-Toe program</a>
        to make the computer play against you.
      </p>
<p>
<strong>On this page</strong>, you'll review the blocks in your previous
        Tic-Tac-Toe project.
      </p>

<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li>
          Open your <strong>U3L3-TicTacToe</strong> project, and save it as
          <strong>U5L6-TicTacToe</strong> so you'll still have your old version
          as a backup.
        </li>
<li>
          Play part of a game, stop before finishing, and then click on each of
          the following blocks.
          <img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>
          Discuss what each expression does and how its code works.
          <ol type="a">
<li>
<img alt="board" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/board.png" title="board"/>
<div class="sidenote">
                You can edit a block to remind yourself of how it works if
                you've forgotten.

<li>
<img alt="possible winning triples" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/possible-winning-triples.png" title="possible winning triples"/>
</li>
<li>
<img alt="status of all winning triples" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/status-of-all-winning-triples.png" title="status of all winning triples"/>

<li>
<img alt="Talk with Another Pair" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" title="Talk with Another Pair"/>
          Two of these blocks report what's on the board but in different ways:
          <code>status of all winning triples</code> and <code>board</code>. Why
          do you need both of those? When do you use each of them?
        </li>
<li>
          What tells the program that clicking in a square means to move in that
          square? How does it know which square you clicked?
        </li>
</ol>

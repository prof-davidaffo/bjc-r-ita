<p>Computers can be useful in processing data to gain information, but your ability process data depends both on your capabilities and the tools you have available.</p>
<p><strong>On this page</strong>, you will build various tools (specifically, selectors) to help you answer questions about data that interests you.</p>
<div class="endnote">You learned about selectors on <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/2-data-structures-art/2-quizzes.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment" title="Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 2: Planning a Quiz App">Unit 2 Lab 2 Page 2: Planning a Quiz App</a>.</div>

Download the CSV file for the data you want to explore.
					<div class="endnote">Snap<em>!</em> allows you to import data in the CSV format. You can convert an XLS or XLSX file into a CSV: open it in a spreadsheet program (such as Google Sheets), and download it as a CSV so you can drag that into Snap<em>!</em>. The Tableau website also has JSON, PDF, and ZIP files; these are harder to process and are not recommended for this lab. </div>
</li>
<li>Open Snap<em>!</em> and drag the downloaded file into the Snap<em>!</em> window. You should see a table full of data. Look over the data (including the <em>column headings</em> in the top row) to give yourself a sense of what kind of information is included. Then click "OK" to close the window. You can still see the data in the watcher on the Snap<em>!</em> stage.</li>

            You may be familiar with tables from spreadsheet applications (such as Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Microsoft Excel) which store tabular data in different file formats. Spreadsheet programs help efficiently organize information, and they can find trends in data automatically (such as the line shown at right). CSV is an open spreadsheet format that works in any of these applications and in Snap<em>!</em>.

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#hint-CSV" title="What does CSV stand for">What does CSV stand for?</a>
<div class="collapse" id="hint-CSV">
                CSV stands for "comma separated values." CSV files are tables of data stored with commas between each item in a row and line breaks between each row in the table. (You can see the commas and line breaks of a CSV by opening it in a text editor.)

<p>Although spreadsheets are a common kind of data, they aren't the only kind. Consider the list of words that you used in Lab 1 to check spelling. It's not a <em>list of lists</em> with two dimensions of data (rows and columns); it's just a <em>list</em> with one dimension of data. "Spreadsheet" refers to two-dimensional data organized in rows and columns. "Dataset" is the more general term for <em>any</em> collection of data, including simple, one-dimensional lists; spreadsheets (two-dimensional lists of lists); and more complicated datasets such as spreadsheets with multiple tabs. </p>

<h3>Challenges in Collecting Data</h3>

<div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.C.3, DAT-2.C.2 all bullets</div>
<p>Researchers often face challenges with data before they even begin analysis. Suppose you are combining data from different countries about distances between cities, and you discover that the distance data from the U.S. is measured in miles, but the distance data from Europe is measured in kilometers; to make meaningful comparisons, you need <em>uniform</em> data (all in miles or all in kilometers). As another example, if you use an online survey to collect data, the way participants abbreviate, spell, or capitalize their entries may vary. Data may also be incomplete (if some people didn't complete the survey) or invalid (if some people made mistakes).</p>
<div class="vocabFullWidth">: <strong>Cleaning Data</strong>
<div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.C.4, DAT-2.E.2</div>
<p><strong>Cleaning data</strong> is the process of making the data uniform <em>without changing its meaning</em> (such as replacing abbreviations, spellings, and capitalizations with the intended word or converting miles to kilometers). Programmers can use programs to filter and clean digital data, thereby gaining insight and knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="ap-standard">DAT-2.C.5</div>
<p>Imagine you read in the news that people who eat a lot of broccoli are less likely to get cancer. The conclusion that broccoli prevents cancer could be a result of <em>bias</em>. It could be that people who eat a lot of broccoli tend to be the same people who also get a lot of exercise, and it's actually the exercise that makes the difference. In research, the term "bias" doesn't have to mean prejudice; it's about reasons the data might not mean what they seem to mean.</p>
<p>People sometimes think that the way to overcome bias is to use a bigger sample (asking more people if they eat broccoli and have cancer). But if the bigger sample has the same problem (people getting more exercise also eat more broccoli), then a bigger sample won't eliminate the bias.</p>

                            You can use a similar approach here by first building a <img alt="row with maximum in column () between row () and row ()" class="" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/row-with-max-between.png" title="row with maximum in column () between row () and row ()"/> that compares a specific field (column) for two rows and reports the row with the higher value in the specified column.</p>

                    Writing specific field numbers into the code is problematic for several reasons:  It's easy to get wrong, it makes for unreadable code, and (this actually happened with the <var>cars</var> database between edits of BJC) the layout of a table might change over time.
                    <ul>
<li>Write a block <img alt="field named () from record () of table ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/field-named.png" title="field named () from record () of table ()"/> that looks for the given name in the table <em>header</em> , finds what item number it is in the header list, and uses that as the field number to extract from the given record.</li>
<li>Also write <img alt="column named () of table ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/column-named.png" title="column named () of table ()"/>, which should take the full table (header and data) as input, but should report the desired column from only the data of the table (so that the result can be used directly as input to blocks such as AVERAGE OF LIST).</li>
<li>You may find <img alt="index of () in ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/index-of.png" title="index of () in ()index of () in ()"/> helpful.</li>

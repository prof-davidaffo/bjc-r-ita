        management. In 2014 she launched TransTech Social Enterprises, a
        nonprofit that helps people lift themselves out of poverty through
        technical training and digital work creating a social impact and
        bringing economic empowerment to marginalized trans and gender non

      Until recently, many economists argued that jobs lost through automation
      would be replaced by new jobs controlling the machinery. Recent research
      has established that the number of new technology-control jobs is too
      small to make up for the jobs replaced by the technology. There
      <em>are</em> new jobs available, but they're not as good as the old ones;
      they are some or all of part-time, low-pay, short-term, or without
      benefits such as health insurance.

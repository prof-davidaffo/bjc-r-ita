<h2>Curve Stitching</h2>


<div class="learn">
<strong>In this project,</strong> you will create a mathematical art design and explore its variations. (Click the picture to see an animation.)<br/>

<p>
            This design uses straight lines to make shapes that look curved and is sometimes sewn with thread or drawn on paper. Here are some examples of and variations on this design made with string, computers, pencils on paper, and even pencils glued together:

<ol>
<li>With your partner discuss how to make this design.  Develop an <em>algorithm</em> that will generate the first quadrant of the design and then use <em>abstraction</em> to extend the design to the other quadrants.</li>
<li>
                    Write a Snap<em>!</em> program to generate the design.

                                There are many possible approaches to this problem. One approach could use the <code>for</code> block:<br/>

                    Using the same principles, create a surrounding frame for your design.<br/>

                    Add another copy of the design slanted at 45° as shown below.<br/>

                                You could use the Pythagorean Theorem:<br/>

                    Here are some more variations that employ color and more complex geometric arrangements.  Create these and your own variations in Snap<em>!</em>.<br/>

                    Use what you know about creating animations in Snap<em>!</em> to produce an animation based on this design.  To allow for dynamic movements such as rotations, you will need to devise a completely different way of creating your design than using fixed coordinates.

                                This animation explores the artistic concept of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space" target="_blank">negative space</a>" by using a grid of rotating copies of the design. How would you revise your program to generate animations like this?<br/>

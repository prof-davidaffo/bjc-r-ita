<h2>Modeling Sentence Structures</h2>


<p>
      On this page, you'll use abstraction to create a "Sentence Builder"
      project that builds complicated sentences like "the little elephant runs
      happily around the wise pizza" by joining words that represent
      <em>things</em>, <em>actions</em>, <em>modifiers</em>, and so on.
    </p>
<!--      <div class="endnote">The examples will be in English. You may use any language you like. For this kind of exercise, English is less complicated than some other languages.  </div>   -->
<!--	
        	The page is designed to give students a fun mini-project in which the use of lists feels natural and empowering.  The less we have to talk about grammar, the better!  
            It's not clear to me why we have to include the possessives at all.  I've edited the grammar lesson below so that it's at least sensible, but I'm not convinced it contributes to the students' enjoyment of the course.  I think the other grammatical categories are well enough implicitly defined by the sample words in each list; even prepositions can be introduced without comment, given the examples. --BH
        </div>  -->
<p>
      The <code>join</code> block connects strings of characters given as input
      without adding spaces, like this:
      <img alt="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/join_elephant.png" title="join (the) (elephant) (climbs)"/>
</p>
<p>
      The <code>join words</code> block does the same and adds a space between
      its inputs, like this:
      <img alt="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/joinwords_elephant.png" title="join words (the) (elephant) (climbs)"/>

<br/>
          Feel free to change these lists to use your own nouns, verbs, etc. In
          fact, you may find you <em>need</em> to change some of these words to
          make the sentences work the way you want.

        Morgan and Betty are trying to use the lists of words to build
        sentences.

<div>
<span>Betty:</span> The sentence "the elephant climbs" is just an
        example. Let's build a block that joins any determiner with a noun and a
        verb.

</div>
<div>
<span>Betty:</span> What? Oh, these are <em>all</em> the words in those
        lists. We want just one item from each of the three lists.

          from each of the three lists and puts spaces between the words. Create
          a reporter called
          <img alt="green 'simple sentence' reporter block" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/simple-sentence.png" title="green 'simple sentence' reporter block"/>
          that uses that expression to generate random sentences.

<div class="sidenote">
          These phrases will be grammatically correct, but they won't
          necessarily make sense. For example, <code>noun phrase</code> might
          generate "a tired pizza."
        </div>
<li>
          Make three other reporters that report different kinds of phrases:
          <ol>
<li>
<img alt="green noun phrase reporter block" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/noun_phrase.png" title="green noun phrase reporter block"/>
              should join words from three categories to create phrases like
              "the little boy," "a green giraffe," or "our old sandwich."
            </li>
<li>
<img alt="green prepositional phrase reporter block" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/prep_phrase.png" title="green prepositional phrase reporter block"/>
              should combine a preposition with a <code>noun phrase</code> to
              create phrases like "near the little boy" or "over a wise pizza."
            </li>
<div class="takeNote">
              Defining <code>prepositional phrase</code> using the
              <code>noun phrase</code> block is a good example of abstraction.
              If you later change <code>noun phrase</code> to include people's
              names, <code>prepositional phrase</code> will still work.
            </div>
<li>
<img alt="Save Your Work" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-mini.png" title="Save Your Work"/><img alt="green verb phrase reporter block" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/verb_phrase.png" title="green verb phrase reporter block"/>
              should join a verb and an adverb to create phrases like "jumps
              sadly," "naps quickly," or "thinks sleepily."
            </li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
          Then, make a reporter
          <img alt="green 'complex sentence' reporter block" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/complex-sentence.png" title="green 'complex sentence' reporter block"/>
          that combines a noun phrase, a verb phrase, and a prepositional
          phrase.

        This page is a very small beginning toward teaching the computer to
        understand English sentence structure. If you find the topic
        interesting, there's a lot more you can do; this could be the beginning
        of your final course project.
        <em>You don't have to do any of this.</em> If you find it boring, go to
        the next page. But if you find it interesting, there's a long road from
        "The blue elephant sits down angrily in front of the
        television" to "Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my
        own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these
        pages must show." (That's the opening sentence of
        <em>David Copperfield</em> by Charles Dickens.) Here are a few
        suggestions to make your sentences more interesting, but don't be
        limited by them; be creative.
      </p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
          Occasionally include people's names instead of a
          <code>noun phrase</code>. So, instead of something like "my silly
          elephant", the program could sometimes use "Alfred" or some other
          names.
        </li>
<li>
          Noun phrases don't always have to have one adjective. They can have
          none, or two, or more.
        </li>
<div class="sidenoteBig">
          Your old Snap<em>!</em> project should be called "U2Lab1-Plural".
        </div>
<li>
          Use your <code>plural</code> block from
          <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/5-plurals1.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment">Unit 2</a>
          to let your nouns sometimes be plural. Your program may need two
          separate expressions, one for singular sentences and one for plural
          ones, since the verb has to match the noun: "the kangaroo jumps" but
          "the kangaroos jump."
        </li>

<li>
          Find a way to create questions. (The sentence could start with a
          <code>question phrase</code> like "Who," "Why does," "Did," or "How
          did." Different question words might require different sentence
          structures.)
        </li>
<li>
          So far you've used verbs that describe an action someone just does
          (<em>intransitive</em> verbs). Another kind of verb describes an
          action someone does <em>to someone,</em> or
          <em>to something,</em> such as "eats" or "sits on"
          or "loves" (<em>transitive</em> verbs). Make a list of
          transitive verbs, and make sentences using
          <code>noun phrase</code> twice, once for the actor and once for the
          acted-upon.
        </li>
<!--          <div class="endnote">You might want to create a <code>question verb phrase </code> block that is a version of <code>verb phrase</code> that reports the  verb without the "s" as the end. Compare the statement "The tired elephant climb<strong><em>s</em></strong> over the pizza" to the question "Did the tired elephant climb_ over the pizza?" </div>  -->

      In this project, you will create tools to explore op art—a form of
      visual art using optical illusions.<br/>

      Initially, the mouse is used to draw rectangles. Then when the user
      presses the space bar, the drawing phase ends and the mouse click becomes
      a paint bucket that fills bounded regions with paint. Here are two
      examples of phase 1 (drawing rectangles) and phase 2 (filling regions):

          In the drawing phase (phase 1), you will be drawing many rectangles by
          clicking and dragging from corner to opposite corner, so it will be
          helpful to have an abstract data type (ADT) to manage the corner
          points.<br/>

<img alt="Opposite corners of a rectangle" class="indent" height="150" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/OpArt_img/corner12.png" title="Opposite corners of a rectangle"/><br/>
<ol>
<li>
              Create a constructor <code>corner</code> that will report a list
              of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates of one corner.<br/>
<img alt="corner x:(mouse x) y:(mouse y) reporting {-1177, -34}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/corner-reporting.png" title="corner x:(mouse x) y:(mouse y) reporting {-1177, -34}"/>
</li>
<li>
              Create two selectors <code>x of corner</code> and
              <code>y of corner</code> that will report either the <em>x</em> or
              <em>y</em> values for an input <var>corner</var>.<br/>
<img alt="x of corner: (corner) reporting -239" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/x-of-corner-reporting.png" title="x of corner: (corner) reporting -239"/>
<img alt="y of corner: (corner) reporting 38" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/y-of-corner-reporting.png" title="y of corner: (corner) reporting 38"/>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
          Create two global variables to temporarily store the two points of
          each rectangle as it is drawn:
          <ul>
<li>
<var>current corner 1</var>: to store the coordinates where the
              mouse is first clicked
            </li>
<li>
<var>current corner 2</var>: to store the coordinates where the
              mouse is moved as the rectangle is drawn (when the mouse is
              released, this value will be the final position of the second
              corner)
            </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
          Now create a <code>rectangle</code> ADT for storing the two opposite
          corners of a single rectangle.<br/>
<img alt="rectangle, corner 1: (current corner 1) corner 2: (current corner 2) reporting {{-239, 38}, {41, -7}}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/rectangle-reporting.png" title="rectangle, corner1:(corner1) corner2:(corner2){report(list(corner1)(corner2)}"/><br/>

<img alt="corner 2 of rectangle reporting {41, -7}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/corner-2-of-rectangle-reporting.png" title="corner 2 of rectangle reporting {41, -7}"/>
</li>

<p>
      Like in the Animation Studio project on the previous page, the stage will
      have to be cleared and redrawn many times so that the user can see each
      new rectangle changing in size as it drawn. The program needs a way to
      store all of the rectangles that have already been drawn so that they can
      be redrawn along with the current rectangle after each stage clear.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>
          Create a global variable <var>rectangle list</var> to store the all
          the rectangles that have been drawn.
        </li>
<li>
          Your program needs a way to know whether the user is finished drawing.
          Create a global variable <var>drawing done?</var> that will store a
          Boolean value (either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) to keep
          track of the phase of the program (drawing or painting).
        </li>

<li>
          The program also needs a way to draw a rectangle given its two
          defining corners. Create a <code>draw rectangle</code> block, and test
          that it correctly draws a rectangle with the input corners.<br/>

</li>
<li>
          Use the seven blocks and four variables you have created to create a
          program that:
          <ul>
<li>
              repeatedly collects rectangles until the user is finished phase 1
              (drawing) by:
              <ul>
<li>
                  collecting the coordinates of the first corner when the user
                  starts to draw a rectangle
                </li>
<li>
                  repeatedly collecting the coordinates of the second corner and
                  redrawing that rectangle and all previous rectangles until the
                  user releases the mouse to finish the rectangle
                </li>
<li>
                  storing the final coordinates for each rectangle so they can
                  be drawn again
                </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
              uses a keystroke (like space) to tell the computer to switch to
              phase 2 (painting) and then fills the clicked areas

                  and <code>hide</code> hides the sprite.

          It is possible to fully automate the painting phase by using the
          following algorithm:
          <ul>
<li>
              for every pixel on the screen find out inside how many rectangles
              it is inside
            </li>
<li>
              color each pixel black if the number is odd and white if the
              number is even (or vice versa)
            </li>
</ul>
          To understand why this algorithm works, use paper and pencil to apply
          it to simple cases with few overlapping rectangles.<br/>

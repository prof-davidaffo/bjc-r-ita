<h2>Brick Wall (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
<p>
      Designing a program to draw this picture—a brick wall that you might later
      use as a stage background in some program you write—is good practice in
      analyzing structure.

<h3>Abstraction</h3>
<p>
        While any good programming language might have many tools for drawing
        and moving, it wouldn't make sense to have special tools for drawing
        bricks because most programs don't involve bricks. That is the sort of
        tool you make yourself when you need it.
      </p>
<p>
        When you need to draw bricks, having a special
        <img alt="draw-brick" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png"/>
        block lets your code use terms directly related to the problem you are
        trying to solve, rather than the more general-purpose terms that the
        computer uses for all kinds of tasks. The process of moving from what
        the programming language gives you to a natural language (one that
        humans speak to communicate) is a key part of good abstraction.
      </p>
<p>
        In this problem, you will build an abstraction for drawing a brick wall,
        first by creating
        <img alt="draw-brick" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png"/>, then blocks for drawing rows, and ultimately the goal:
        <img alt="draw-brick-wall-n" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png"/>.

<h3>Drawing One Brick</h3>
<p>
        A picture of a brick is rectangle, filled in "brick red" (darker than
        the primary-color red). There's no <code>draw rectangle</code> block in
        <span class="snap">snap</span>. One way to fake it is by thinking of a
        rectangle as a very thick line.
      </p>

<ol>

          Try out this block.
          <div class="endnote">
            If your "brick" has rounded ends, remember that you can

              change how lines are drawn
            </a>
            by clicking the settings button (<img alt="Settings menu button" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/sys/settings.png" title="Settings menu button"/>) in the toolbar, and turning on "Flat line ends." Rounded ends
            stick out beyond the length you specified. Here's a picture of the
            rounded brick with a regular line (pen size 1) of the same length
            inside it:
            <img alt="Round brick" border="0" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/round-brick.png" title="round brick"/>
<p>
              Rounded ends are better for most line drawings, but not for
              drawing bricks.

<h3>Using Problem Decomposition to Write an Abstraction</h3>
<p>You'd like the "top level" block to be something like this:</p>
<img alt="draw-brick-wall-7" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-wall-7.png"/>
<p>
      A human brick-layer would understand exactly how to build such a wall. A
      computer doesn't know, so you must fill in the details. This means going
      from the abstract (draw a brick wall) to the concrete (pardon the pun).
      This involves <strong>problem decomposition</strong>.
    </p>
<p>
      There are two kinds of rows, so we make blocks that specialize in each:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Row A</strong>:
        <img alt="Row A" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-a.png" title="Row A"/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Row B</strong>:
        <img alt="Row B" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/row-b.png" title="Row B"/>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="ifTime">
<ol start="2">
<li>
          Make blocks
          <img alt="Row A" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowa-block.png"/>
          and
          <img alt="Row B" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/rowb-block.png"/>.
        </li>
<li>
          Think about what helper blocks besides
          <img alt="Draw Brick" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick.png"/>
          you might want.
        </li>
<div class="takeNote">
<p>
<strong>Too much abstraction? </strong>It's possible to go overboard
            on abstraction and build so many blocks that your program is just as
            cluttered as it would be without the special blocks.
          </p>
<p>
            But it can also be useful to make a special block even when its
            definition is just one built-in block. For example, to draw the
            mortar (the cement between bricks, shown as white space), you can
            just use
            <img alt="Move 4 Steps" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png"/>, but it might make sense to define a
            <code>draw mortar</code> block.
          </p>
<p>
            Why? You might later decide that 4 steps is the wrong thickness for
            mortar, and you'd rather have 5. Or you might want the mortar to be
            cement-colored, slightly gray. And your complete project might have
            <img alt="Move 4 Steps" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/move4.png"/>
            blocks that <em>aren't</em> about mortar. With many
            <code>move</code> blocks scattered through your program, you would
            have to find and change each one, and keep putting in
            <code>set pen color</code> blocks. With a
            <code>draw mortar</code> block, you can just change its definition,
            and all the mortar in your picture will be changed.
          </p>
</div>
<li>
<p>
            The two kinds of rows should be exactly the same length. Your first
            try at drawing Row B may be a little too long. If so, think through
            what causes that bug.
          </p>
<p>
            How are you going to fix it? Should Row B have different-size
            bricks, different-size mortar gaps, or different-size half-bricks?
            If you're not sure, try all the possibilities and see which looks
            right in the finished wall. Or think "What would
            <em>make most sense</em> in a <em>real</em> brick wall?"
          </p>
</li>
<li>
          Once you have rows A and B the same length, you can write the
          <img alt="Draw a Brick Wall with ( ) Rows" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/abstraction/new-brickwall/draw-brick-wall-num.png"/>
          block. Make sure that it works sensibly for both even and odd numbers
          of rows.
        </li>
</ol>
<img alt="Now Would be a Good Time to Save" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-now.png" title="Now Would be a Good Time to Save"/>
</div>
<div class="takeItFurther">
<ol type="A">
<li>
<p>
            After you've drawn the picture at the top of this page, add more
            inputs to the <code>Draw a Brick Wall</code> block:
          </p>
<ol style="list-style: lower-roman">
<li>Length of the wall (how many bricks)</li>
<li>Length of a brick</li>
<li>Mortar thickness</li>
</ol>
<p>
            Add these one at a time, not all at once! When you modify the length
            of a brick, that should also change the length of a half-brick. When
            you modify the mortar thickness, that should also change the
            distance between rows (since that's mortar too).
          </p>

<h2>GPS Forensics: Drawing Conclusions</h2>
<p>
      Eye-balling through your visualization is fine, but precise conclusions
      require more. So let's put it all together and find out how well your
      clustering did. The goal is to come up with a quality statement like: "<em>X</em>
      percent of the points lie within <em>Y</em> clusters."
    </p>
<p>
      Aiming at high values of <em>X</em> would provide evidence for the
      validation of our hypothesis—that is, most of the points should lie
      within a few clusters.

          Create a block that takes as an input:
          <ul>
<li>the cluster data,</li>
<li>the clusters themselves, and</li>
<li>a distance</li>
</ul>
          and returns how many points lie within in.<br/>

</li>

<li>
          Once you have implemented this block, you can use it by extending the
          above code:<br/>
<img alt="" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/fraction-of-list-of-lists-within-list-of-lists-extended.png" title=""/>
</li>
</ol>
      Implement, experiment, and then discuss with your peers:<br/>

<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>
<li>How many clusters did you find? How many points did fit?</li>
<li>
          Did you validate the multiple perpetrator hypothesis? If so, how many
          criminals need to be hunted?
        </li>
<li>
          How sure are you of your conclusions? Are there other possible
          outcomes? If so, how could they be validated?
        </li>
</ol>

              For the first part of this lab you are going to be in a similar
              situation as a forensic analyst who works for a law enforcement
              agency. In other words, you will be doing the work of a computer
              forensic specialist as you might have seen on any of the popular
              TV series like CSI, NCIS, or similar. The author of this lab likes
              the character Abby from
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCIS_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank">NCIS</a>
              :-)
            </p>
<p>
              Here is your case:  In a kidnapping case, the criminal got
              away with the ransom even though the handover had been planned out
              very well by your colleagues. They thought it would have been a
              sure thing.  Angry and frustrated, your NCIS field colleagues
              come back to you with a set of GPS coordinates that have been
              included in the Twitter messages that the kidnapper used to
              communicate with them during "negotation". They want you to
              reconstruct the movements of the perpetrator.
            </p>
<p>
              Here are the coordinates:<br/>
              37.869050 -122.272050<br/>
              37.869110 -122.271941<br/>
              37.869116 -122.271957<br/>
              37.869201 -122.272136<br/>
              37.869118 -122.271967<br/>
              37.869084 -122.271931<br/>
              37.869192 -122.272132<br/>
              37.869178 -122.272136<br/>
              37.869102 -122.271957<br/>
              37.868922 -122.272110
            </p>
<p>
              You will use exactly these coordinates through the remainder of
              part I of the lab.

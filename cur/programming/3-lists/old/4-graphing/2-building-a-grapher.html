<h2>Building a Graphing App</h2>

<div class="learn">
<strong>On this page</strong>, you will learn how to scale values so that
      you can graph any data set on the Snap<em>!</em> stage. Blocks to do the
      calculations are already written for you but you can, if you like, examine
      them to see how they work.
    </div>
<p>
      Plotting a single point, given its two coordinates, should feel this
      basic:<br/>
<img alt="plot point x: (x) y: (y){pen up; go to x:(x) y:(y); pen down; move(1) steps; move(-1) steps}" class="indent" height="225" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/plotpointxy.png" title="plot point x: (x) y: (y){pen up; go to x:(x) y:(y); pen down; move(1) steps; move(-1) steps}"/>
</p>
<p>
      Then you could graph a list of data points by inventing a block like
      <img alt="Graph datapoints: ()" height="40" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/Graph datapoints.png" title="Graph datapoints: ()"/>
      just like your work in Unit 2 Lab 2. Depending on the kind of graph you
      want, you can connect the dots or not.
    </p>
<p>
      That seems like all you should need. But what if the <em>scale</em> of
      your data does not fit on the Snap<em>!</em> stage (between -240 and 240
      in the <em>x</em> direction and between -180 and 180 in the
      <em>y</em> direction)? For example, what if you want to plot the
      popularity of a baby name over time, like this?<br/>
<img alt="Snap Stage Coordinates" class="indent" height="250" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/SnapStageCoordinates.png" title="Snap Stage Coordinates"/>
<img alt="percentage of births named Derek by year" height="250" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/PercentageOfDerekByYear.png" title="percentage of births named Derek by year"/>
</p>
<p>
      The years can't be plotted on the horizontal because those values are
      completely off Snap<em>!</em>'s stage. And the percent values 0, 0.1, 0.2,
      0.3, etc., are so close to each other that they would all look the same.
      We wouldn't see the increase in popularity between 1960 and 1980 at all.
      We need a way to <em>convert</em> between Snap<em>!</em>  
      <strong>stage coordinates</strong> and the values—we'll call them the
      <strong>graph coordinates</strong>—for a given set of data points.
    </p>
<div class="takeNote">
      A good grapher needs to let the user set the <strong>scale</strong> of the
      screen, to specify where to focus attention—where to zoom in.

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

          It contains several blocks already built for your convenience.
          <ol>
<li>
              Click the <code>set graph scale</code> block with the inputs it
              already has (-2, 4, 30, 300) to see what it does. In addition to
              drawing on the screen, it sets several variables that your other
              blocks will need so that they know the intended screen dimensions.
            </li>
<li>
              The following two blocks report the Snap<em>!</em>
<strong><em>stage</em></strong> coordinates given the
              <strong><em>graph</em></strong> coordinates of a point. Experiment
              with inputs to these two blocks to get them to report 0.<br/>
<img alt="xStage for xGraph: ()" height="40" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/xStageforxGraph.png" title="xStage for xGraph: ()"/>
<img alt="yStage for yGraph: ()" height="40" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/yStageforyGraph.png" title="yStage for yGraph: ()"/><br/>
              How do your input numbers relate to the graph scale?
            </li>
<li>
              Use
              <img alt="go to x: (xStage for xGraph: ()) y: (yStage for yGraph: ())" height="50" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/gotoxStageyStage.png" title="go to x: (xStage for xGraph: ()) y: (yStage for yGraph: ())"/>
              with those same input numbers. Where does it put the sprite?
            </li>
<li>
              Without changing the sprite's position, click
              <img alt="xGraph at xStage: (x position)" height="40" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/xGraphatxStagexposition.png" title="xGraph at xStage: (x position)"/>
              and explain the result you get.
            </li>
<li>
              Use the
              <img alt="when I am dropped" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/when-I-am-dropped.png" title="when I am dropped"/>
              block to create a script that tells the sprite to say its correct
              <strong><em>graph</em></strong> coordinates (not its
              <strong><em>stage</em></strong> coordinates) wherever it is
              dropped. Move the sprite to a few places on the stage to test your
              script.
            </li>
<div class="endnote">
              For this graph, a sprite at the bottom right corner of the stage
              should say (4, 30), not (240, -180). To see the full display of
              coordinates use
              <img alt="round () to (2) decimal places" height="30" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/roundto2decimal.png" title="round () to (2) decimal places"/>
              block (in the Operators palette, built for this project) to round
              the coordinates reported to the decimal places you want to see. A
              display of
              <img alt="sprite-saying-two-decimal-places" height="55" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/sprite-saying-two-decimal-places.png" title="sprite-saying-two-decimal-places"/>
              makes more sense than
              <img alt="sprite-saying-too-many-decimal-places" height="73" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/sprite-saying-too-many-decimal-places.png" title="sprite-saying-too-many-decimal-places"/>
              in this context.
            </div>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
          Experiment with various inputs to <code>set graph scale</code> to see
          where it puts the axes and how it represents the substitutes for the
          axes, when the point (0, 0) would not appear on the stage. Drag the
          sprite a few places to see if the sprite says what you expect. Then
          change the inputs of <code>set graph scale</code> to fit the range of
          years and percents in name data and click it to reset the scale of the
          screen. Again, check to see if your sprite says what you expect when
          you move it around the stage. <br/><img alt="set graph scale, xMin:(1927) xMax:(2014) yMin:(0) yMax:(0.5)" class="indent" height="50" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/setgraphscale.png" title="set graph scale, xMin:(1927) xMax:(2014) yMin:(0) yMax:(0.5)"/>
</li>
<li>
          Build the following block which takes the
          <strong><em>graph</em></strong> coordinates of a data point and have
          the sprite go to the corresponding
          <strong><em>stage</em></strong> coordinates.<br/>
<img alt="go to xGraph:(x#) yGraph:(y#){go to x:(xStage for xGraph:(x)) y:(yStage for yGraph:(y)) }" class="indent" height="120" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/gotoxGraphyGraph.png" title="go to xGraph:(x#) yGraph:(y#){go to x:(xStage for xGraph:(x)) y:(yStage for yGraph:(y)) }"/>.
          <p>
            On the baby name graph for Derek, the point (1971, 0.25) is roughly
            in the middle of the screen. Check to see if
            <img alt="go to xGraph:(1971) yGraph:(0.25)" height="45" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/gotoxGraph1971.png" title="go to xGraph:(1971) yGraph:(0.25)"/>
            is working as you expect it to.
          </p>
<img alt="percentage of births named Derek by year" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/PercentageOfDerekByYear.png" title="percentage of births named Derek by year"/>
</li>
<li>
          Then, build
          <img alt="plot point xGraph:() yGraph:()" height="50" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/plotpointxGraphyGraph.png" title="plot point xGraph:() yGraph:()"/>
          so that it uses
          <img alt="go to xGraph:() yGraph:()" height="50" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/gotoxGraph.png" title="go to xGraph:() yGraph:()"/>
          instead of plain
          <img alt="go to x: () y: ()" height="50" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/gotoxy.png" title="go to x: () y: ()"/>. Check it to make sure it works as you expect it to.
        </li>
<li>
          Finally, build
          <img alt="Graph datapoints: ()" height="50" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/Graph datapoints.png" title="Graph datapoints: ()"/>
          to make a dot at every datapoint. (For this graph, you will want the
          points connected. For the data on the next page you will want them
          separate. Make sure you design this block in a way that makes that
          feature easy to change.) Apply it to <code>DerekData1927to2015</code>.
          The points of your graph may or may not be connected and the axes
          won't have labels, but it should otherwise look like the graph
          above.<br/>

<li>Save your work as "U3L4-GraphingApp".</li>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="ifTime">
<ol start="7">
<li>
          Invent a way to tell your grapher, for each graph you make, whether to
          connect the points or not. You will want to have a Boolean input type
          for indicating if points are connected.<br/>

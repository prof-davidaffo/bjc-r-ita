<h2>Improving Your Graphing App</h2>

<div class="learn">
<strong>On this page</strong>, you'll work with a dataset on a classroom
      of 27 sixth-graders. You will create a graph of height vs. weight, showing
      the boys and girls in different colors that also allows you to examine
      individual datapoints to see their approximate values, like this:<br/>
<img alt="animation of weight vs height data set being graphed" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/GraphingDataSet.gif" title="animation of weight vs height data set being graphed"/>
</div>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<!--<li>What can you say about this particular class of sixth-graders based on the graph of height vs. weight data you see above?</li>-->
<li>
          Load your grapher from before; it should have been saved as
          "U3L4-GraphingApp."
        </li>
<li>
          Look in the Variables palette for this dataset on a classroom of 27
          sixth-graders:
          <img alt="Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/5-algorithms/Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats.png" title="Gr6-age-height-weight-gender-stats"/>. Each data point in this set represents a person and contains
          <em>four</em> items:
          <ul>
<img alt="list (137.4)(146.52)(40.52)(F)" height="90" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/persondata2.png" title="list (137.4)(146.52)(40.52)(F)"/>
<li>age in months</li>
<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>
<li>height in centimeters</li>
<li>weight in kilograms</li>
<li>gender</li>
</ul>
          Your
          <img alt="Graph datapoints: ()" height="40" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/Graph datapoints.png" title="Graph datapoints: ()"/>
          was written to expect only <em>two</em> numbers in each datapoint as
          it was built with blocks like
          <img alt="plot point xGraph:() yGraph:()" height="42" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/plotpointxGraphyGraph.png" title="plot point xGraph:() yGraph:()"/>. Will it even work with this dataset? Try it. What does it do?
        </li>
<li>
          Create a selector <code>age</code> which extracts the age of an input
          person.<br/>
<img alt="age, person: (person){report(item(1) of (person))}" class="indent" height="100" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/ageperson.png" title="age, person: (person){report(item(1) of (person))}"/>
</li>
<li>
          Similarly, create selectors <code>height</code>, <code>weight</code>,
          <code>gender</code> which extract the height, weight and gender of an
          input person.
        </li>
<li>
          Now use the above selectors to create custom blocks that report:
          <ul>
<li><code>ages</code>—a list containing only the 27 ages</li>
<li>
<code>heights</code>—a list containing only the 27 heights
            </li>
<li>
<code>weights</code>—a list containing only the 27 weights
            </li>
</ul>
<div class="endnote">
            For example: you can use the Higher-Order Function
            <code>map</code> together with the selector <code>age</code> to
            extract a list of ages from the data:<br/>
<img alt="ages, data: (data){report(map(age, person()) over(data)}" class="indent" height="110" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/agesdata.png" title="ages, data: (data){report(map(age, person()) over(data)}"/>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<!--Did they?<div class="sidenote">You've built averaging blocks before.</div>-->
          Create a block that takes a list of numbers as input and reports the
          <em>average</em> value.
        </li>
<li>
          Create a block, <code>female data</code>, using <code>keep</code>,
          that reports a list containing all the datapoints of only the girls,
          and another block, <code>male data</code>, that does the same for the
          boys.
        </li>
<li>
          You will need to <code>set graph scale</code> for each of these
          graphs. Searching through the data to find the lowest and highest
          values can be a nuisance. Create tools to do that for you.
          <img alt="min of list ()" height="35" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/minoflist.png" title="min of list ()"/><img alt="max of list ()" height="35" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/maxoflist.png" title="max of list ()"/>
</li>
<li>
          You now have everything you need to create a graph of height vs.
          weight, showing the boys and girls in different colors that also
          allows you to examine individual datapoints to see their approximate
          values, as shown in the animation above. Build it.<br/>
<div class="endnote">
            The following blocks may help you extract the information you need
            from the data set.<br/>
<img alt="map () over (); list(height, person:())(weight, person:()); male data, data: (); Gr6 age-height-weight-gender stats" height="100" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/U3ImageVideoAddendum_img/hintblocks.png" title="map () over (); list(height, person:())(weight, person:()); male data, data: (); Gr6 age-height-weight-gender stats"/>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<img alt="Talk with Another Pair" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-another-pair.png" title="Talk with Another Pair"/>
          Use the tools you have built to create a few separate graphs: age
          against height or weight, height against weight, separated or not
          separated by gender—and <em>also mark the averages</em> in each case.
          What can you say about this particular class of sixth-graders based on
          the data?<br/>
<div class="takeNote">
            Collaboration is vital to solving data driven problems because it
            allows the application of multiple perspectives and skill sets to
            gain insights and knowledge about data that may not be possible when
            working alone.

          The graph above shows <em>three</em> aspects of each child in the
          class (height, weight, and gender). Find some suitable way to give
          some information about the fourth element of the data (age). Pen size
          is one possibility, but you might find a different way.<br/>

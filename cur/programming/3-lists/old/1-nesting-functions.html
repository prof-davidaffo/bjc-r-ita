<h2>Nesting Function Calls (Teacher's Choice)</h2>
<!--        -->
<p>
        	Here are 3 powerful higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as input):
        	<ul>
<li>
<img alt="Import Tools" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/import-tools.png" title="Import Tools"/>
<code>Map</code> <em>performs a function</em> on each item in a list and outputs a <em>list</em>, which you first saw in <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/3-first-list-experience.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment">Using Lists to Write <code>Vowel?</code></a>.<br/>
<img alt="map(join-a-or-an-with())over(list-elephant-lion-eel-mouse-anteater)" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/map(join-a-or-an-with())over(list-elephant-lion-eel-mouse-anteater).png" title="map(join-a-or-an-with())over(list-elephant-lion-eel-mouse-anteater)"/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<code>Keep</code> <em>chooses</em> specific items and outputs a <em>list</em>, which you first saw in <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/5-plurals1.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment">Developing a Block That Makes Plurals</a>.<br/>
<img alt="keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list.png"/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<code>Combine</code> <em>calls a combining function</em> (a function with two inputs) across all items in the set and outputs an object that may be a  <em>number, string, or list</em>, depending on the combiner, which you may have seen in <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/old-script-variables/2-script-variable-projects.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment">Script Variable Projects</a>.<br/>
<img alt="factorial: combine with times items of numbers from 1 to n" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/better-factorial.png"/>
</li>
</ul>
            The three can be used together to build more advanced functions.

<h3>Character Encoding</h3>
<!--	  -->
<p>Every character you type is encoded by the computer as a number. Unicode assigns a number to every letter that can be typed in any language, as well as to special characters, such as !, @, #, ö, λ, ♣, and the space bar.</p>
<div class="sidenote">ASCII is a small subset of Unicode that includes letters, numbers, and a few symbols. The list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Latin_script" target="_blank">Unicode characters</a> is much longer.</div>

<img alt="ASCII chart for capital letters" class="noshadow" height="360" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/ascii-chart.png" title="ASCII chart for capital letters">
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Use the green block <img alt="unicode of (a)" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/unicode_of_a.png" title="unicode of (a)"> to figure out the unicode for "A", "Z", "a", and "z". </img></li>
<li>Use the green block <img alt="unicode(65)as letter" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/unicode_65_as_letter.png" title="unicode(65)as letter"/> to figure out the letter for the unicode numbers 72, 105, 33. </li>
<!--		<div class="sidenote"><code>map</code> and <code>combine</code> will be helpful here. </div>	-->
<li>Use those blocks, along with the higher-order functions from the previous lab, to decode this message:<br/><a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/3-lists/old/U3Lab3CodedMessage.xml"> <img alt="list of unicode numbers" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/code.png" title="list of unicode numbers"/> </a></li>

If so, compare the technique you used then with the technique you used now with lists.  How do they differ?</div>
Write a block <code>encode (message)</code> that takes an input message (a sentence), tears it into letter-sized chunks, gets the unicode, adds 1 to each letter, and reports the encoded message.</li>
<li>Build a <code>decode (message)</code> block to reverse <code>encode (message)</code>.</li>

<div class="sidenoteBig">You could use <code>mod</code> to make the letters of the alphabet loop around to the beginning. You will need to take into account that A is 65.</div>
<ol type="A">
<li>Build an <code>encode (message) by (offset)</code> block that takes an input message and an offset value, gets the unicode of the message, adds the offset to each letter, and outputs the encoded message.</li>
<li>Build a <code>decode (message) by (offset)</code> block that takes an input message and an offset value and reverse <code>encode (message) by (offset)</code>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Acronym Generator</h3>

<p>An <strong>acronym</strong> is a "word" made up of the first letters of every capitalized word in a phrase. For example, the acronym for United States of America is USA, and SUNY is an acronym for State University of New York.</p>
<p>In this project, you will create a reporter block that takes a phrase as input and reports an acronym made <em>only from the capitalized words</em>. It should work like this:<br/>
<img alt="Beauty and Joy of Computing: BJC" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/acronym_BJC.png" title="Beauty and Joy of Computing: BJC"/>
<img alt="New York City: NYC" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/acronym_NYC.png" title="New York City: NYC"/> </p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="6">
<li>
                    Create a reporter that takes a phrase as input and reports an acronym made of the first letters of the capitalized words. The steps below suggest <em>one</em> way: 
                    <ol>
<img alt="Import Tools" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/import-tools.png" title="Import Tools"/>
<li>The input phrase is a string of characters. Break it up into a list of words. </li>
<div class="takeNote">There are many ways to turn a string like "Beauty and Joy of Computing" into a list of words. One way is to use this green block: <img alt="sentence to list" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/sentence_to_list.png" title="sentence to list"/> (pronounced "sentence to list"). It lets you break a string at every space and convert the string to a list of words. It's in the Tools library.</div>
<div class="sidenote">The <code>unicode of</code> block will be helpful here.</div>
<li>You have choices about the next step. You could use <code>map</code> to generate a new list containing only the first letters of the words in your input list, and <em>then</em> <code>keep</code> only those that are capital letters.  <strong>OR</strong>, you could <code>keep</code> only the words that begin with capitals and <em>then</em> use <code>map</code> to create a list containing only the first letters of those words.
                        </li>
<li><img alt="Save Your Work" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-mini.png" title="Save Your Work"/>Last, you need to convert that list back into a string.
                        </li>
</ol>

</ol>

                This is the list of employees of a small company.  <small>(Taken from <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> by Abelson and Sussman. Creative Commons licensed.)</small> Each of the smaller lists contains a person's name, job title, and yearly salary.
                <p>"This company spends more money on the big bosses than on the people who do the work," says Alyssa one day.  Is she right?  Write an expression to compute the total salaries of everyone paid less than $100,000 per year.  Then find the total for everyone paid more than $100,000 per year.</p>
</li>
<li>Ben suggests that the results will be more convincing in the form of a list containing that total and all the names of the people in that category (paid less than $100,000, for example). So, if there are five people in that category, your list will have six items: first the total of the salaries, and then the names of the people. Try this both for less than $100,000 and for more than $100,000.
            <li>Find the <em>average</em> salary of people paid less than $100,000 per year.

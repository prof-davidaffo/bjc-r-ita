				Alpha and Beta are considering the block <img alt="green predicate block: increasing?(list)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/increasing_block.png" title="green predicate block: increasing?(list)"/>, which returns <code>true</code> when the items of the list are in increasing order (equal neighbors are ok) and <code>false</code> otherwise. For example: <br/>
<img alt="increasing?(list 1,4,7,10) is true" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/increasing_true.png" title="increasing?(list 1,4,7,10) is true"/>
<img alt="increasing?(list 1,7,4,10) is false" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/increasing_false.png" title="increasing?(list 1,7,4,10) is false"/>
</div>


<div><span>Betty:</span> Let's develop our algorithm, you know, the plan what we want the code to do.</div>
<div><span>Morgan:</span> Ok. <em>(Pauses to think.)</em> Well, we need to compare each item to all the others, but we can't do that all at once, so we'll need to compare each one at a time...</div>
<div><span>Morgan:</span> We could compare item 1 to item 2 and check that item 1 is less, and then compare item 2 to item 3 and check if item 2 is less, and then compare item 3 to item 4 and check that item 3 is less, all the way to the end. And, we'll know it's the end when we reach item "length of" for the list!</div>
<div> ok, and if we get "false" even once...
            <div> <em>(Interrupting)</em> Then we know it's not increasing!
            <div><span>Morgan:</span> Yeah, that works... </div>
<div class="stagedir">They pause to think.</div>
<div><span>Morgan:</span> You're saying we don't care about the item number, just the item itself. So we could use a <code>for each</code> loop. For each item in the list, we compare it to... what? </div>
<div><span>Betty:</span> What if we make a variable that keeps track of the highest number so far? Then we can check each item against that number, then reset the variable to equal to current item.</div>
<div><span>Morgan:</span> Ok, here's what I have so far.</div>

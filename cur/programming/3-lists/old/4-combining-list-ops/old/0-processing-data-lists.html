<span>Morgan:</span> The <code>map</code> block applies some function to
        each item of a list.
      </div>
<div>
<span>Betty:</span> The <code>keep</code> block lets you choose some
        items from a list and not others.
      </div>
<div>
<span>Morgan:</span> And <code>combine with</code> takes an operation
        (like <code>+</code>) and a list. It combines all the items of the list
        into a single output using the operation. So, with <code>+</code>, it
        would give the sum of all the numebrs in the list.
      </div>
<div>
<span>Betty:</span> Would we ever use all three of the functions
        together?

          Think of another situation where it might be useful to use
          <code>map</code>, <code>keep</code>, and
          <code>combine with</code> together.

<span>Morgan:</span> I guess you could start with a list of numbers,
        <code>keep</code> the ones that were greater than 50, use
        <code>map</code> to add 10 to all of them, and then use
        <code>combine with</code> to add those new numbers up.
      </div>
<div>
<span>Betty:</span> OK, let's try it. I'm just going to make up a
        variable called "list of numbers". Then we'll <code>keep</code> the
        numbers over 50.
      </div>
<div class="stagedir">
        Betty builds this expression:
        <img alt="keep(()&gt;50)from(listofNumbers)" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/keep_listofNum.png" title="keep(()&gt;50)from(listofNumbers)"/>
</div>
<div>
<span>Morgan:</span> Then we add 10 to every item using
        <code>map</code>. And the list we're mapping over is everything over 50
        that we kept, so let's just drag everything in our
        <code>keep</code> expression in there.
      </div>

<div class="stagedir">
        Morgan builds this expression using Betty's:
        <img alt="map(()+10)over(keep...)" border="0" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/keep_map.png" title="map(()+10)over(keep...)"/>
</div>
<div>
<span>Betty:</span> Your last idea was to add all these new numbers up,
        right? So we'll use <code>combine with</code> and addition, and our list
        is everything in the <code>map</code> expression.
      </div>
<div class="stagedir">
        Betty adds to Morgan's expression:

          Try Morgan and Betty's invention with a list of your own. Change the
          operations in <code>combine with</code> and <code>map</code>, too.

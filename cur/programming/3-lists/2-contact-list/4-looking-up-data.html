      As you add more contacts to your list, it will become less and less
      realistic to find the one you want by reading through the whole list. So
      building a search feature will become essential for finding the desired
      information efficiently. Lists, adding and removing items from lists, and
      searching lists are common features in many programs.

        Farida Bedwei (born in 1979) is a software engineer and the
        co-founder/Chief Technology Officer of Logiciel, a financial technology
        company based in Ghana. Due to difficulties in muscle control as a
        result of cerebral palsy, she began using a typewriter as an alternative
        to writing at an early age. Badwei attributes her future interest in
        computers to this early reliance on technology. In addition to being
        named as one of the most successful women in finance technology in
        Africa, Bedwei is a powerful advocate and role model for girls in STEM
        and for people with disabilities.

          Write a predicate function that takes two contacts as inputs. It
          should return True if the first contact belongs before the second one
          in a sorted contact list. That is, you'll have to extract the names
          (in sorted form) from the two contacts, and then use
          <code>&lt;</code> to compare them. Respect the data abstractions.
        </li>
<li>
          Make a block to sort the contact list. To do the actual sorting, you
          can load the "List utilities" library. It has a block
          <img alt="sort 'list input slot' ordering with 'predicate input slot'" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/sort-block.png" title="sort 'list input slot' ordering with 'predicate input slot'"/>. Use the contact list as the first input. The second input should
          be the predicate function you just wrote. (Leave its two input slots
          empty.) The <code>sort</code> block will report a new, sorted contact
          list.

          We've been sloppy so far in talking about name formats. Most people in
          the United States say their given name (the one their parents chose
          for them) first, and their family name last. But in China, for
          example, the family name comes first. So "Sun Yat-sen" is a member of
          the Sun family.
          <ul>
<li>How should the name "Sun Yat-sen" be displayed to the user?</li>
<li>
              How should "Sun Yat-sen" look in order to sort contacts by family
              name?
            </li>
<li>
              What about someone with a middle name, such as Martin Luther King?
              Is the middle name a family name or a given name?

          Here's the tricky part: To make this all work correctly, a name (as
          defined by the <code>name</code> ADT) has to know whether it's a
          given-first name such as Jasmine Anderson or a family-first name such
          as Sun Yat-Sen. <strong>Redefine your Name ADT</strong> to make it a
          list of <em>three</em> items. The first will be either the text
          'given-first' or 'family-first'. This first item is called a
          <em>type tag.</em> The second item will be the given name (or names),
          and the third will be the family name (or names).
          <div class="endnote">
            You've been using type tags all along without knowing it. Many
            programming languages, including Snap<i>!</i>, attach type tags to
            every value, saying "I am a list" or "I am a number" and so on. The
            user (i.e., you) doesn't see the type tags, unless you provide a bad
            input to a primitive block, and you see a message like "Expecting
            list but getting text."

<strong>Reading a name:</strong> Find where you ask the user for first
          and last name, and change the code to ask for given name(s) and family
          name. Also ask which comes first. You might want to have two name
          constructors,
          <img alt="contact name, given-first, from given: () family: ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/given-first-constructor.png" title="contact name, given-first, from given: () family: ()"/>
          and
          <img alt="contact name, family-first, from given: () family: ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/family-first-constructor.png" title="contact name, family-first, from given: () family: ()"/>.
        </li>
<li>
<img alt="Tough Stuff" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" title="Tough Stuff"/><strong>Writing a name:</strong> Modify your
          <img alt="name, display form, from contact 'list input slot" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/name-display-form-from-contact.png" title="name, display form, from contact 'list input slot"/>

          so that they check the type tag of the name (the first item) when
          necessary. Be careful about when to add a comma.

          Make sure your <code>find contacts</code> block and your sorting of

          of names.

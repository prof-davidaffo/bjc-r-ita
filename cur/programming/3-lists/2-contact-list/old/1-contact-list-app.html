<h2>Contact<a class="anchor" name="contactlist"> </a>List App</h2>

<p>
      All cell phones have some kind of Contacts list. In this lab, you will
      build a Contacts app yourself.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>
          Load
          <a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/3-lists/old/U3L2-ContactList.xml">this starter version</a>
          of the app.
        </li>
<li>
          Press the "Add Contact" button on the stage, and read the script to
          understand how it works. Each new contact is a list (item 1 is a name
          and item 2 should be a phone number), so the list of contacts is a
          <em>list of lists</em>.
        </li>
<li>
          Fix the
          <img alt="get phone" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/get-phone.png"/>
          block so that it works similarly to
          <img alt="get name" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/get-name.png"/>.
        </li>
<li>
          Clear your contact list and add a few made-up people to make sure
          everything works.
        </li>

<li>
          Write a reporter
          <img alt="phone number of ()" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.png"/>
          that takes any part of a person's name as input, and reports that
          person's phone number, or "not found" if the name is not in the
          contact list. You will need:
          <ol type="a">
<li>
<img alt="&lt;string () contains ()&gt;" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/string-contains.png"/>, which lets you find out whether one string (a contact's name
              in the list) contains another string (a name or part of a name).
            </li>
<li>
<img alt="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/keep.png" title="keep items 'predicate input slot' from 'list input slot'"/>, which filters the list for only the items that make the
              function true.
            </li>
<li>
<img alt="is 'list input slot' empty?" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/empty.png" title="is 'list input slot' empty?"/>, which returns <code>true</code> if the list is empty and
              <code>false</code> otherwise.
            </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
          When someone calls you, the phone company sends only the calling
          number to your phone, not the person's name. But if the number is in
          your contact list, your phone figures out the name. So you'll also
          want a block<img alt="name from number ()" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png"/>
          that searches for a phone number and reports the contact's name.
        </li>
</ol>
</div>
<img alt="Save your work" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-now.png" title="Save your work"/>
    Make sure everything works the way you want it to before going on. Then
    save!

    <div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="7">
<li>
<!--<div class="sidenote">In some cultures, the family name—the one you  use for alphabetizing—is written first. For example, in "Sun Yat-Sen" the family name is "Sun." So instead of asking for "first and middle name(s)" and for "last name" you might want to say "given name(s)" and "family name."</div> -->
          Our starter version of the app uses a single text string to hold a
          person's entire name. This is fine for displaying the name on the
          screen but makes it hard to display a list of all contacts
          <em>sorted by last
            <!--family-->
            name.</em>
          So we really want to keep the last
          <!--family-->
          name separate from the first
          <!--given-->
          name(s).
          <ol type="a">
<li>
              Modify the
              <img alt="get name" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/get-name.png"/>
              block so that it asks separately for first
              <!--given-->
              names and for last
              <!--family-->
              name and then reports a list of the two answers. Check to make
              sure that adding a new contact does what you expect.
            </li>
<li>
<strong>Clear your contact list</strong> and add a few entries in
              the new format.
            </li>
<li>
              Write two reporters that take a contact as input and report the
              name as a text string, in two different orders:<br/>
<img alt="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/name-display-result.png" title="name (display form) --&gt; Abraham Lincoln"/><br/>
<img alt="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/name-sorting-result.png" title="name (sorting form) --&gt; Lincoln, Abraham"/><br/>
<!--(Don't worry, yet, about how to handle family-name-first names. We'll get to that soon.)-->
</li>
<img alt="Save Your Work" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-mini.png" title="Save Your Work"/>
<li>
              Check whether your
              <img alt="phone number of ()" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/phone-number-of.png"/>
              and
              <img alt="name from number ()" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/name-from-number.png"/>
              blocks still work. Use your
              <code>name (display form)</code> selector to fix any problems.
            </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
      You will soon make more improvements to this app, after addressing the
      idea of <em>abstract data types,</em> which you'll need when we return to
      the contact app.

<h2>Adding Birthdays</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page,</strong> you will develop an abstract data type (ADT) to store and access <em>dates</em>, and you will adapt your contact ADT to use it to store each contact's birthday.<br/>
<img alt="contact with name: ... birthday: (date (July) (9) (2005))" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/contact-constructor-with-birthdate.png" title="contact with name: ... birthday: (date (July) (9) (2005))"/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="takeNote">
<p>As we add more complexity to contacts—birthday, work address, and so on—the location of each data point (such as the phone number) inside a contact might change. This is where an abstract data type helps. If you were to move the phone number as you refine your contact ADT, you <em>could</em> fix every single block that uses the phone number, or if you have an ADT, you could just fix the one <em>selector</em> that chooses the phone number from the list. With that one change, all the other blocks using that selector will get the data they need automatically.</p>

<div class="ap-standard">AAP-1.D.5</div>
<p>Notice that name, address, and text are strings, but birthdate is a list. You can combine elements of different types in a list. </p>

<ol>
<li>
                	Create an ADT to manage three data points for each date: <var>month</var>, <var>day</var>, and <var>year</var>.
                    <ol>
<li>
                            Create a <code>date</code> <em>constructor</em> that accepts this data as input and then reports a date as a list of three items. <br/>
<img alt="date (July) (9) (2005) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/date-constructor-reporting.png" title="date (July) (9) (2005) reporting {July, 9, 2005}"/>
</li>
<li>
                            Write three <em>selector</em> blocks to retrieve the specific data (month, day, or year) from the inputted date. <br/>
<img alt="month from date: () reporting July" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/date-constructor-in-month-selector-reporting.png" title="month from date: () reporting July"/>

                	Integrate your <code>date</code> ADT into the <code>contact</code> ADT.

<li>
                            Edit the <code>contact</code> constructor block definition to accept a birthdate as a list by using the <code>date</code> constructor. <br/>

</li>
<li>
                            Create a <code>birthdate from contact</code> <em>selector</em> to retrieve the contact birthdate from the inputted contact.<br/>
<img alt="birthdate from contact: (contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005))) reporting {July, 9, 2005}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/birthdate-from-contact-reporting.png" title="birthdate from contact: (contact with name: (Betsy) address: (123 Main St., New York NY 10001) phone: (212-555-1234) birthdate: (date (July) (9) (2005))) reporting {July, 9, 2005}"/>

<li>
                            Adapt your "Add Contact" button to input this new type of contact into your list.

<p>You could use several ask and answer blocks together with script variables.</p>
<p>
                                        Another way is to use <em>abstraction</em> and create another helper, <img alt="ask birthdate" class="inlinde" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/ask-birthdate.png" title="ask birthdate"/> that reports a list of the user's answers to these prompts:
                                        <ul>
<li>What is the contact's birth month?</li>
<li>What is the contact's birth day?</li>

<h2>Using Every List Item</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will create a <code>how old</code> reporter to determine the age of a contact, and you will use it together with the <code>map</code> block to find the age of every contact in your list.</p>

</div>
<h3>Creating the <code>How Old</code> Reporter</h3>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>

<li>
                    Then, write the third selector: <code>month (as number) from date</code>.<br/>
<img alt="month as number from date: ()" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/date-constructor-in-month-as-number-selector.png" title="month as number from date: ()"/>

<h3 class="box-head">Changing Months from Words to Numbers</h3>
<p>The <code>day from date</code> and <code>year from date</code> blocks are straightforward to program, but <code>month (as number) from date</code> requires selecting the month and then also changing it from a word to a number.</p>
<p>
                            To build <code>month (as number) from date</code>:
                      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li>
                                    Create a <code>month (as number) from date</code> reporter in the Operators palette that accepts a list (that it calls <var>date</var>) as input.<br/>
<img alt="month (as number) from date hat block" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/month-as-number-from-date-hat.png" title="month (as number) from date hat block"/>
</li>
<li>
                                    Initialize (create and set) two script variables: 
                                    <ul>
<li><var>month from date</var> that works like <code>day from date</code> and <code>year from date</code> and returns the month <em>as a word</em></li>
<li><var>list of months</var> that reports a list of the twelve months of the year (correctly spelled and capitalized)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
                                    Loop through the numbers 1 through 12, checking if <var>month from date</var> is that number item in the <var>list of months</var>.
                                    <ul>
<li><img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>If it is, what should the block report?</li>
<li>If there is no match, make the block report 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
                    Create a reporter that accepts a contact as input and reports the age of that contact.
                    <ol>
<li>
                            First, create five script variables:<br/>
<img alt="'how old is (contact)' hat block and 5 script variables: contact birth month-number, contact birth day, contact birth year, high guess, low guess" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/how-old-is-hat-with-script-vars.png" title="'how old is (contact)' hat block and 5 script variables: contact birth month-number, contact birth day, contact birth year, high guess, low guess"/>
</li>
<li>Set the first three using the appropriate date selector together with the <code>birthdate from contact</code> selector.</li>
<li>

<img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/>Set the two guess selectors.
                            <ol>
<li>One of the two guesses should be <img alt="(current year) - (contact birth year)" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/current-year-minus-contact-birth-year.png" title="(current year) - (contact birth year)"/>. Why?</li>
<li>Should the <var>high guess</var> or the <var>low guess</var> have that value?</li>
<li>What value should the other guess have?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Determine whether the contact's birth month is less than or greater than the <code>current month</code> (found in the Sensing palette) and report the appropriate guess in either case.</li>
<li>
                        	If the contact's birth month is equal to the current month, then:
                        	<ol>
<li>Determine whether <var>contact birth day</var> is less than or greater than <code>current day</code> and report the appropriate guess in either case.</li>
<li>If <var>contact birth day</var> is equal to the <code>current day</code>, then broadcast "birthday" and report the appropriate guess.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<strong>Debug.</strong> Test your <code>how old</code> block with several contacts.<br/>

<h2>Solving a Word Puzzle</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page</strong>, you will solve a crossword puzzle by
        combining predicates using the <code>and</code> block. You will then use
        the resulting predicates with <code>keep</code> to find words with
        specific characteristics.

          You have used the
          <img alt="length of ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/length-of-blank-operator.png" title="length of ()"/>
          block in the Operators palette together with <code>=</code> and
          <code>keep</code> to find words of a certain length in the
          <var>words list</var>.
          <ol>
<li>
              Reassemble that script so that you can find all the words that
              have 8 letters.
            </li>
<li>Find all the words that have 11 letters.</li>
<li>
              You now have an <em>expression</em> that you can edit to test any
              word for any number of letters. This is a useful tool to have.
              Create and test a predicate <em>block</em> that takes a word and
              number as input and works like this:<br/>
<img alt="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/does-orange-6-letters-true.png" title="does (orange) have (6) letters? reporting true"/>
<img alt="does (apple) have (7) letters? reporting false" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/does-apple-7-letters-false.png" title="does (apple) have (7) letters? reporting false"/>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
          Build an <em>expression</em> using the
          <img alt="letter () of ()" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/letter-blank-of-blank.png" title="letter () of ()"/>
          block with <code>=</code> and <code>keep</code> to find words that
          have certain letters in certain places.
          <ol>
<li>Use it to find all the words that begin with the letter i.</li>
<li>Find all the words whose fourth letter is r.</li>
<div class="sidenote">
              Your block's title can be different from the one shown here as
              long as it does the same job.
            </div>
<li>
              If you have not yet turned your expression into a predicate
              <em>block</em>, do that now. Your block should work like this:
              <br/>
<img alt="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/is-letter-4-of-carrot-o-reporting-false.png" title="is letter (4) of (carrot) the letter (o)? reporting false"/>
<img alt="is letter (2) of (giraffe) the letter (i)? reporting true" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/is-letter-2-of-giraffe-i-reporting-true.png" title="is letter (2) of (giraffe) the letter (i)? reporting true"/>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Work with another pair.</strong> Use your predicates, along
          with <code>and</code> and <code>keep</code>, to solve

            For example, this expression searches for 6 letter words that start
            with <var>r</var> and have <var>d</var> as the third letter:

          Create and test a predicate block that checks whether a certain letter
          is in a word. Examples below. Your block should:
          <ul>
<li>
              Accept two inputs: a <var>letter</var> to check for and a
              <var>word</var>, and
            </li>
<li>
              Report whether or not the input <var>word</var> has the input
              <var>letter</var>.
            </li>
</ul>

<img alt="Tough Stuff" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/tough-stuff-mini.png" title="Tough Stuff"/>

          The first input is a
          <em>pattern,</em> which is a word in which some of the letters have
          been replaced by hyphens (minus signs).

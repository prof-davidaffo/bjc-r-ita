<h2>Modeling Language: Plurals, Part 2</h2>


<p>
      You can improve <code>plural</code> to work correctly with more words. If
      the project is not already open, please reload it. (The suggested filename
      was <code>U2-Plural</code>.)

<strong>Abstraction:</strong> Language often has special cases. In
            English, the plurals of some nouns add "s"; some add "es"; nouns
            like "calf" and "fly" become "calves" and "flies", changing their
            final letters before adding "es". And more. For a programming task
            this complex, it's (generally) best to break it into parts, handle
            each part separately with its own procedure (its own block), and
            then have the "top-level" block—in this case, <code>plural</code>,
            itself—use those specialists. That is, instead of coding every
            little detail directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and
            clearer to make <code>plural</code> look something like this.<br/>
<img alt="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s" class="indent noshadow" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-abstract-definition.png" title="abstract definition of plural: if h = last letter of word, report h-case plural; if y = last letter of word, report y-case plural; if some other case, use a block that specializes in that case; etc.; else report join word s"/>

            Showing<a class="anchor" name="abstraction"> </a>the
            <em>structure</em> of the method—just the overall strategy—in the
            "top-level" block and leaving the details to separate blocks is one
            part of an important computer science idea called
            <em>abstraction</em>. Abstraction keeps your code clear, readable,
            and more easily debugged. It will also help your code be more
            flexible.
          </p>
</div>
<li>
          When you trust your new specialist block, edit <code> plural</code> to
          use the specialist. Test (you can use <code>map</code>) to make sure
          <code>plural</code> still works for all the words it used to work for,
          as well as the new ones.
        </li>
<li>
          Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like
          <img alt="plural-y (tray) reporting 'trays'" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_y-tray-with-result.png" title="plural-y (tray) reporting 'trays'"/>
          and
          <img alt="plural-y (sky) reporting 'skies'" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_y-sky-with-result.png" title="plural-y (sky) reporting 'skies'"/>
</li>
<div class="endnote">
          Remember, any specialist can make mistakes if it's asked to do a job
          that isn't its specialty. For example:<br/>
<img alt="plural-y (mouse) reporting 'mousies'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png" title="plural-y (mouse) reporting 'mousies'"/><br/>
          Make sure <code>plural</code> gives <code>plural-y</code> only words
          it knows how to handle correctly.
        </div>
<img alt="Save your work" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-now.png" title="Save your work"/>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="takeItFurther">


<ol type="A">
<li>
          Extend <code>plural</code> to correctly handle a input word that has a
          space at the end.
          <div class="endnote">
<p>
              Right now, if <code>plural</code> is given a word with a space at
              the end, it leaves that space in the plural:<br/>
<img alt="plural (bulldog ) reporting 'bulldog s'. There is a space after 'bulldog' in the input and a space between 'bulldog' and 's' in the reported value." class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" title="plural (bulldog ) reporting 'bulldog s'. There is a space after 'bulldog' in the input and a space between 'bulldog' and 's' in the reported value."/><br/>
              Figure out how to handle this special case and edit
              <code>plural</code> so that the result is<br/>
<img alt="plural (bulldog ) reporting 'bulldogs'. There is a space after 'bulldog' in the input but no space in the reported value." class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldogs).png" title="plural (bulldog ) reporting 'bulldogs'. There is a space after 'bulldog' in the input but no space in the reported value."/><br/>
              You already have a block that <em>specializes</em> in making
              plurals of words that <em>don't</em> have a space at the end.
              <em>Use</em> it.
            </p>
</div>
<p>
            Surprise! Once <code>plural</code> works for a single space at the
            end of a word, try giving it
            <img alt="plural (bulldog      ). There iare six spaces after 'bulldog' in the input." src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[four-spaces].png" title="plural (bulldog      ). There iare six spaces after 'bulldog' in the input."/>. That works too! But why?

<li>
<img alt="Tough Stuff" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/tough-stuff.png" title="Tough Stuff"/>
          Does your <code>plurals</code> block still feel cluttered, even though
          the details about how to handle each possible last letter are
          abstracted into specialist blocks? One way to improve on this
          situation is to use another kind of abstraction called
          <em>data-directed programming.</em>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>
              Start by making a list of <em>key-value pairs</em>, with last
              letters as the keys and specialist procedures as the values:<br/>
<img alt="set (plural specialists) to (list (list (h) (ringed plural-h ( ) block)) (list (y) (ringed plural-y ( ) block)) (list (f) (ringed plural-f ( ) block)) (list (x) (ringed (join ( ) (es)) block)) (list (...) (...)))" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-specialists-list.png" title="set (plural specialists) to (list (list (h) (ringed plural-h ( ) block)) (list (y) (ringed plural-y ( ) block)) (list (f) (ringed plural-f ( ) block)) (list (x) (ringed (join ( ) (es)) block)) (list (...) (...)))"/><br/>
<div class="narrowpurple">
                To make the second item of each small list, find the block you
                want, put it in the second input to <code>list</code>, then
                right-click on the block and choose "ringify." As the "x"
                example shows, it doesn't have to be a block named
                <code>plural-</code>something. It just has to have an empty
                input slot where you want the word to go.
              </div>
</li>
<li>

              Then in your <code>plural</code> procedure, you can replace most
              of the <code>if</code> blocks with<br/>
<img alt="script variables (pair)
set (pair) to (find first item (ringed ((item (1) of ( )) = (last letter of (word)))) in (plural specialists))
if (is (pair) a (list)?) {
    report (call (item (2) of (pair)) with inputs (word))
}" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-specialist-dispatch.png" title="script variables (pair)
set (pair) to (find first item (ringed ((item (1) of ( )) = (last letter of (word)))) in (plural specialists))
if (is (pair) a (list)?) {
    report (call (item (2) of (pair)) with inputs (word))
}"/><br/>
<div class="narrowpurple">

<p>
<code>Find first</code> is a higher-order function works
                  similarly to <code>keep</code>, but it reports only the first
                  item that's found. It is equivalent to
                  <code>item (1) of (keep)</code>.
                </p>

<p>
                  The <code>call</code> block in the palette doesn't include the
                  "<code>with inputs</code>" in the picture; when you click on
                  its right arrowhead, those words will appear along with an
                  input slot. The <code>call</code> block's first input slot is
                  the empty gray ring, which means that <code>call</code> wants
                  a block in that input slot. When you drag
                  <code>item 2 of pair</code> into that slot, the ring remains
                  around it. That's usually what we want when using
                  <code>call</code>, but not this time. Right-click on the
                  <code>item of</code> block and choose "unringify" from the
                  menu.
                </p>
<div class="endnote">
                  You can experiment with <code>call</code> to see what else you
                  can do with it. What happens if you don't unringify the
                  <code>item</code> block? What happens if you leave out the
                  "<code>with inputs</code>" and the second input?
                </div>
</div>
</li>
<li>

              There's no reason the keys have to be single letters. Modify the
              code in <code>plural</code> so that it tests all
              <em>trailing substrings</em> of the word against the specialist
              list. That is, if the word is "ditch," you'd look in the
              specialist list for "ditch," then for "itch," then "tch," "ch,"
              and finally, if nothing else is found, "h." You'd put<br/>
<img alt="list (ch) (ringed block (join ( ) (es)))" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/ch-dispatch.png" title="list (ch) (ringed block (join ( ) (es)))"/><br/>
              in the list, and then words ending "ch" would have "es" added.
              This mechanism is very general; it works even for special cases
              such as<br/>
<img alt="list (child) (ringified (word (children)))" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/child-dispatch.png" title="list (child) (ringified (word (children)))"/><br/>
              (You'll have to define the <code>word</code> function that just
              reports its input; it's needed because you can't type letters
              directly into a ring.) <em>Now</em> you have a
              <em>really</em> uncluttered <code>plural</code> block. And it'll
              even work for a language other than English, if you make a
              different specialist list.
            </li>
<li>

              If you modify the trailing-substring test so that instead of
              giving up if it can't find the last letter of the word as a key,
              it goes one step further and looks for an <em>empty</em> key in
              the specialist list, and you add<br/>
<img alt="(item ( ) (ringed (join ( ) (s))))" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/default-dispatch.png" title="(item ( ) (ringed (join ( ) (s))))"/><br/>
              to the list, then you can be sure that every possible word will
              match that, if nothing else, so you don't need the
              <code>if</code> any more. Your <code>plural</code> block can now
              be just one-line:
              <code>report (call (item 2 of (longest trailing substring ...</code>.
            </li>
<li>
              For an extra challenge, modify your trailing-substring test so
              that a plus sign in the key matches any vowel (it will serve as a
              wild-card character), so you can do this:<br/>
<img alt="list (...) (list (+y) (ringed (join ( ) (s)))) (list (y) (ringed (join (all but last letter of ( )) (ies)))) (...)" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/match-vowels.png" title="list (...) (list (+y) (ringed (join ( ) (s)))) (list (y) (ringed (join (all but last letter of ( )) (ies)))) (...)"/>

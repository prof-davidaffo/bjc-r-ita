                    Morgan and Jasmine are building a program that will take a list of points as input and connect the dots. They sketched the letter A on graph paper and listed the vertices.<br/>

<p>Computers can help us collect data. Sometimes, we want to pull the data off of an image: of a graph, a letter, the coordinates of features of a face, the measurements of some bridge…. This lesson shows how to import an image and digitize particular points that can later be used to reproduce the image or be processed in some other way. (From PG)</p>
<p>write a program so that if we have a picture, we can click on the corners and let the program collect the coordinates</p>
<p>we can import images as a stage background</p>

<p>Morgan and Jasmine are building a program that will take a list of points (each of which is a list of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates) as input and connect the dots. They figure they can use it to draw pictures or graphs of data:</p>
<p>
      To make a set of starting data, they sketched the letter A on graph paper. They chose a <em>scale</em> that they figured would make their picture a good size on the stage.<br/>

<img alt="Letter A drawn of graph paper with corner coordinates" height="300" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/AonGraphPaper2.PNG" title="Letter A drawn of graph paper with corner coordinates"><img alt="Corner coordinates (-50, 20) (-10,120), ... (-30,20)" height="300" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/U2ImageVideoAddendum_img/AonGraphPaper3.PNG" title="Corner coordinates (-50, 20) (-10,120), ... (-30,20)">
<br/>
  Then they  listed  the coordinates of each vertex, starting at the arrow and going clockwise around the figure. The first point is at (-50, 20), the second is (-10, 120), and so on. Then they built that list in Snap<em>!</em> like this:<br/>
<img alt="coordinate-list-for-A" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/coordinate-list-for-A.png" title="coordinate-list-for-A"/><br/>
                    Now they need a script that will use that list to make the drawing, like this:<br/>
<img alt="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates" border="2" class="center" data-gifffer="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/drawA.gif" title="sprite drawing letter A by going to each set of coordinates">
</img></img></img></p>
</div>
<div><span>Jasmine:</span> This list  of coordinates outlines an A, so let's name it A.</div>
<div class="stagedir">

<p>Jasmine clicks <code>Make a variable</code>, names it <code>A</code>,  and builds <img alt="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/A.png" title="set A to {{-50,20}, {-10,120}, {10,120}, {50,20}, {30,20}, {20,50}, {-20,50}, {-30,20}}">. </img></p>
<p>Then she clicks that <code>set</code> block to run it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<span>Morgan:</span> So, for each of those eight points, we want the sprite to move to it. HM... <img alt="go to x:() y:()" height="41" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/go-to-x()-y().png" title="go to x:() y:()"/>  won't  work, because it needs two separate inputs. We need a block that  takes <em>one</em> input, a point like <img alt="list(-50)(20)" height="37" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/list(-50)(20).png" title="list(-50)(20)"/>.
				<!-- <img  src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/A_foreach.png" alt="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" title="script with for each (item) of (A) {glide 1 secs to x:(blank) y:(blank)} then glide to (0, 0)" /> -->
</div>
<div><span>Jasmine:</span> So we'll make a <em>new </em>block. Let's call it <code>go to point</code>. It'll work like this <img alt="go to point (list (-50) (20))" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/go-to-point(list(-50)(20)).png" title="go to point (list (-50) (20))"/>. We'll use  <img alt="go to x:() y:()" height="41" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/go-to-x()-y().png" title="go to x:() y:()"/> or <img alt="glide (.5) secs to x:() y:()" height="41" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/glide(.5)secs-to-x()-y().png" title="glide (.5) secs to x:() y:()"/> <em>inside</em> it, but we'll have to process the input, <img alt="list(-50)(20)" height="37" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/list(-50)(20).png" title="list(-50)(20)"/>, to supply <code>x:</code> and <code>y:</code> separately. Hmmm... </div>
<div><span>Omar:</span>  Oh! I know how! I bet we can use <img alt="item()of(list)" height="35" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/item()of(list).png" title="item()of(list)"/>. Give it a number as its first input. I bet that the <img alt="rectangle with two smaller orange rectangles inside" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/3-lists/list_input_slot.png" title="rectangle with two smaller orange rectangles inside"> just says that it expects a list as its second input.</img></div>
<div><span>Morgan:</span> I wonder if we can make <em>our</em> <code>go to point</code> block show that it expects a list as input....</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, <em>you</em> can make <em>your</em> blocks show what type of data they expect as inputs: a number, a list, or some other type. Some languages <em>require</em> the data type to be indicated. In Snap<em>!</em> it's an option. It's not necessary but, like assigning a color to a block, it can be a helpful reminder of what the block does and what type of input it expects. You've already seen input slots of several shapes, indicating different expected data types. </p>

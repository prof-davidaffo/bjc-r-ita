<h2>Automated Fortune Teller</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>In this project,</strong> you will build an automated fortune
        telling program inspired by the <em>Magic 8 Ball</em><sup>®</sup> that randomly offers answers to YES/NO questions.
        Click the video below to watch the app in action.

          Create your own fortune-telling app. You can personalize it as you
          like. For example, you might create your own messages.

          You may wish to look at the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball" target="_blank" title="Magic 8-Ball">Wikipedia entry for Magic 8 Ball</a><sup>®</sup> for some possible responses that the app could give
          to a yes/no question. Notice that of the twenty possible answers
          listed, ten are affirmative (<span style="color: green">green</span>),
          five are non-committal (<span data-a11y-errors="true" style="color: goldenrod">yellow</span>), and five are negative (<span data-a11y-errors="true" style="color: red">red</span>).

          Personalize your project; use other images for the costumes, and maybe
          even add sounds.
          <div class="endnote">

            You can import images and sound files from your desktop into your
            project by dragging and dropping them into the Snap<em>!</em>
            window.<br/>

          Trick your friends into thinking that your automated fortune teller
          actually knows things and tells the truth. Create a version of your
          model that allows you to select among a certain type of choices when a
          particular key is <em>secretly</em> pressed. For example, maybe when
          the key “1” is pressed only affirmative answers are chosen, when the
          key “2” is pressed only non-committal answers are chosen, when the key
          “3” is pressed only negative answers are chosen.

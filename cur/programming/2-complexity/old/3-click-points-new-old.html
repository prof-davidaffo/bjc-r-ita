<h2>Capturing Clicks to Draw</h2>

      On the previous page, you drew a shape based on a list of points you were

<span>Morgan:</span> Typing in all these coordinates is a pain. Let's

        You will combine parts of two projects: your work from the
        <strong>U2L2-DrawShape</strong> project you saved on the previous page,
        and a starter project for this page.
      </p>
<em>Export <strong>U2L2-DrawShape</strong> blocks</em>
<ol>
<li>Load your <strong>U2L2-DrawShape</strong> project.</li>
<li>
          Choose "Export blocks" from the File menu to save the blocks on your
          computer. (Save all the blocks.)
        </li>
</ol>
<br/><em>Set the stage background</em>
<ol start="3">
<li>
          Load
          <a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/2-complexity/U2L2-Click.xml">this starter project</a>. Below the actual stage are a "Stage" button and a
          "Sprite" button. Click the stage button.<br/>
<img alt="stage button in sprite corral" class="indent" height="200" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/stage-button.png"/>
</li>
<li>
          Now click the "Backgrounds" tab near the top of the window.<br/>
<img alt="backgrounds tab" class="indent" height="300" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/backgrounds.png"/>
<br/>
          You will find two non-empty backgrounds:
          <ul>
<li>
              A graph of median U.S. household income by year (source: Federal
              Reserve Bank of St. Louis)
            </li>
<li>A capital "E" (font: Century Gothic Bold).</li>
</ul>
          The graph is typical of data processing, which is one topic of Unit 3.
          The E continues the activity from the previous page. Choose either
          background by clicking on it. (Later, you can also drag some other
          picture of a graph or letter into the project with the stage selected
          to get a different background.)
        </li>
<li>
          Now go back to the Scripts tab, and choose the "Sprite" button under
          the stage to get back to the sprite's scripts.
        </li>
</ol>
<br/><em>Import your blocks</em>
<ol start="6">
<li>
          Now choose "Import" from the File menu, and import the file

<div>
<span>Jasmine:</span> Yes, and we added new items to a list in
        <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/old/4-learning-names.html">that "greet player" project</a>, also in Unit 1.
      </div>
<div>
<span>Omar:</span> When we click, we should probably also give the user
        some visible feedback that the click has been processed.
      </div>
<div><span>Morgan:</span> What do you mean?</div>
<div>
<span>Omar:</span> Well, the user is going to be following the outline
        of a shape, and clicking at turning points. That may take a while, and
        users get nervous if the computer doesn't seem to be paying attention.
        So I thought we should mark each point the user clicks, a little circle
        or something.
      </div>
<div>
<span>Morgan:</span> I have an idea! There's a
        <img alt="stamp block (in Pen)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/stamp.png"/>
        block that paints a picture of the sprite itself on the stage. That
        arrowhead thingy will point right at the point where the user clicked.

          The project file you loaded contains three unfinished scripts, one for
          each of Jasmine's steps.
          <ul>
<li>
              In the first script, variable <var>point list</var> should be
              given an appropriate initial value.
            </li>
<li>
              In the second script, you need a way to tell the sprite to stop
              following the mouse. Replace the <code>forever</code> block with
              one that will loop only until the user presses the space key.
            </li>
<li>
              In the third script, the <code>stamp</code> block is already in
              place, but you have to write the code that will add the mouse's
              position to the list of points. Use the data abstraction for
              points.

<!-- sorry Mary -->
<div class="takeItFurther">
<ol type="A">

          This is a good quick-and-dirty solution to the problem of entering a
          bunch of points into a list interactively. But it has a couple of
          weaknesses:
          <ul>
<li>
              Even after you tell the sprite to stop following the mouse, the
              "when I am clicked" script is still ready to run, and so if you
              click directly on the sprite, it will still add points to the list
              that you may not want.
            </li>
<li>
              The list of points is always kept in the same global variable. So
              it's messy to create lists for several different letters.
            </li>
</ul>
          For an alternative approach to this problem, with more complicated
          code but without those weaknesses,

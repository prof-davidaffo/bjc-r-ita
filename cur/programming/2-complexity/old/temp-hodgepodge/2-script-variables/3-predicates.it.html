<h2>Building a Useful Collection of Predicates</h2>
<p>
      Some tests—for example, a test to see if a number is even or if a letter
      is a vowel—are needed so often that you won't want to re-create them each
      time you need them. In this activity, you will create a set of tools that
      you may use often, especially for complicated programming tasks.
    </p>
<p>
      You've already built a predicate <code>vowel?</code> to test for vowels
      and a predicate to test for even numbers.
      <span class="snap">snap</span> has a built-in test to see if something is
      a number, but not a test to see if the number is an integer, and often you
      will want that.
    </p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>
<span class="snap">snap</span> has a "greater than" operator
          (<code>&gt;</code>), an "equal" operator (<code>=</code>), and a "less
          than" operator (<code>&lt;</code>) built in, but doesn't have a
          "greater than or equal to" (<code>&gt;=</code>) operator.
          <p>
<img alt="5 &gt;= 3" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/5ge3.png"/><img alt="5 &gt;= 5" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/5ge5.png"/><img alt="3 &gt;= 5" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/3ge5.png"/>
</p>
<p>
            Build
            <img alt="a greater than or equal to b" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/a-greater-than-or-equal-to-b.png"/>
            and test it well to make sure it does what you expect.
          </p>

<div class="endnote">
<ul>
<li>
                When you type the block's title in the
                <strong>Make a block</strong> dialog, choose the hexagonal
                <em>predicate</em> block shape.
              </li>
<li>
                To set the block's name <code>&gt;=</code> between the two input
                slots, use the left plus sign in the Block Editor.
                <img alt="left plus sign" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/left-plus-sign.png"/>
</li>
<li>
                You may find one or more of these Boolean operators helpful:
                <p>
<img alt="and, or, not blocks" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/Booleans.png"/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
            There are several correct ways to do this! As long as your block
            gives the right <code> true</code> and <code> false</code> answers,
            it's correct.
          </p>
</li>
<div class="takeNote">
          Operators like
          <img alt="a times b" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/a-times-b.png"/> that
          stand in between their two inputs are called
          <em><u>in</u>fix</em> operators. Operators like
          <img alt="sqrt of" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/sqrt-of-120x28.png"/>
          that stand before their inputs are called
          <em><u>pre</u>fix</em> operators. When we write <em>n</em>! to mean
          "<em>n</em> factorial," the "!" is a
          <em><u>post</u>fix</em> operator—it comes after its input
          <img alt="n factorial" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/postfix factorial 47 × 27 pixels.png"/>
          In <span class="snap">snap</span>, it is possible to mix the types, as
          you will do in the next problem.
        </div>
<li>
          Build a predicate that tests to see if its input is an integer.
          <img alt="integer?-4=(with-result-true)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/integer-4(with-result-true).png"/>
<img alt="integer?-4-point-1(with-result-false)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/integer-4-point-1(with-result-false).png"/>
<p>
            You may find
            <img alt="round a number" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/round-a-number.png"/>
            useful.
          </p>
</li>
<li>
          Build a block that tells whether a given number is between two other
          given numbers.
          <img alt="number-between-two-others(with-result-false)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/number-between-two-others(with-result-false).png"/>
<img alt="number-between-two-others(with-result-true)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/number-between-two-others(with-result-true).png"/>. You can decide whether "between," for your purposes, will
          <em>include</em> the two boundary numbers or not.
        </li>
<li>
          Write a
          <img alt="weekend?" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/weekend.png"/>
          block that reports whether a given day is a weekend. Let's assume that
          only Saturday and Sunday are part of the weekend.
        </li>
<li>
          Write a
          <img alt="weekday?" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/weekday.png"/>
          block. You could write this without your
          <img alt="weekend?" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/weekend.png"/>
          block, but it'll be much easier (and cleaner code!) if you use
          <img alt="weekend?" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/weekend.png"/>
          as part of this new block.
        </li>

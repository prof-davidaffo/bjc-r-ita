<li>You already wrote and tested <img alt="sum from a to b" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/sum-fromatob-170x27.png"/>. 
		<p>Here are two buggy versions written by other programmers. Imagine you are helping these programmers debug their code. Show exactly where, in <em>their</em> code, a small fix (or two) will make it work correctly and be ready to <em>explain</em> why their code didn't work.</p>

<ol>
<li>Experiment with it to see what it does.</li>
<li>Rename it to make clear what it does.</li>
<li>Then rewrite it, using no <code>if</code> blocks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<img alt="max block being executed" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/max-block-executed-BYOB.jpg">
<li>It is useful to have a <code>max</code> block <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/max.png"/> that takes two numbers as input and  tells which is bigger (the maximum). Four versions of <code>max</code> are shown below, two that <em>report</em> the max value, and two commands that <em>say</em> the max value. One of them doesn't work quite right. .

<ol>
<li>Experiment to find out which one sometimes does the wrong thing. </li>
<li>With your pair programmer, explain why that one is the <em>only</em> one that doesn't work.</li>
<li>Discuss: In a real program, which version would you want in your library, the command or the reporter? Why?</li>

<h2>Reporter Blocks</h2>

<p>You have defined  "command" blocks, blocks that carry out an action like drawing on the stage or having the sprite say something. You have also defined "reporter" blocks, blocks that  perform a calculation (like the plural of a word) and report the result. Many blocks on the "operators" palette are reporters.</p>

<p>

    	    Commands have the click-together groove and bump at the top and  bottom. Reporters are often used <em>inside</em> other blocks, like <code>say</code> or <code>set</code> or <code>move</code> or <code>join</code>. For example:
        </p>
<img alt="say (4 + 7)" class="center" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/cond/say-4-plus-7.png"/><img alt="join t all but first letter of when" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/join-t-all-but-first-letter-of-when-343x33.png"/>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol>
<li> Create a block that takes a number as input and outputs that number squared. Here is one way to do that: <br/> <img alt="square(x) block definition" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/building-blocks/square-of-x.png"/></li>
<li>Now create blocks for these functions:
  					<ol>
<li> <code>cube x</code> that takes a number <em>x</em> as input and outputs <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> </li>
<li> <code> reciprocal x </code> that takes a number <em>x</em> as input and outputs 1/<em>x</em> </li>
<li> <code>phi</code> that takes no input but outputs the value ((square root of 5) + 1) / 2</li>
<li>
<div class="sidenote"><code> abs</code> is a built-in reporter, but write your own.</div>
<code>abs x</code> that takes a number as input and if that number is zero or positive, reports the number, but if the number is less than zero, multiplies it by -1 and reports the result. 
                        </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create a block that converts degrees Farenheit to degrees Celsius. (You can find the conversion formula on Wikipedia and elsewhere.)</li>
<li>
                	Predict what this block will report when it is run with inputs "hello" and 5. <br/>

      The goal now is to build <code>plural</code>, a reporter block that takes
      a noun as input and outputs the plural of the noun, spelled correctly.
      <img alt="plural day (with result)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-day-with-result.png" title="plural day (with result)"/>
<img alt="plural boss (with result)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-boss-with-result.png" title="plural boss (with result)"/>
</p>
<div class="sidenote">
      Choose the <em>reporter</em> button when you make the
      <code>plural</code> block.
      <p>
<img alt="select reporter as block type" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/building-blocks/make-a-reporter.png" title="select reporter as block type"/>
</p>
</div>
<p>Here's one way to start building that block.</p>
<p>
<img alt="plural-(script), first try" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-(script).png" title="plural-(script), first try"/>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="3">
<li>
          Build this much and test it out on at least "day" and "boss" and
          "medicine," to make sure it works correctly for those. If it does not,
          edit and fix it.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Debugging: </strong> Try to find words for which this version
          of <code>plural</code> does <em>not</em> work correctly. List the
          words you find. <em>Organize that list</em>, sorting the words into
          categories according to their last letter. For example, it will get
          wrong some words that end with the letter <em>h</em>. Try to find many
          words it gets wrong.
        </li>
<li>
<strong><em>Save your list.</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>
              Create a Snap<em>!</em> list like this
              <img alt="snap list block containing day, boss, bulldog(with space at end), box, butterfly, brush, and more of your choosing" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/noun-list-for-testing-plural2.png"/>
              containing <em>all</em> of your words.
            </li>
<li>
<div class="saveAs">
<span class="text">"U2L1-Plural"</span><img alt="save your work as U2L1-Plural" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/save-this-as.png" title="save your work as U2L1-Plural"/>
<em>Save your file</em>. You will need this list.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<div class="takeNote">

<p>
<strong>Debugging: </strong>To write good code that works, you want
            to try to "break" it, to find situations in which it does
            <em>not</em> work. This requires thinking of wild and exceptional
            cases, even including inputs that are incorrect in some way, like
            this example, which has a space at the end.
            <img alt="plural of a word with a space following the word" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png" title="plural of a word with a space following the word"/>
</p>
</div>
<li>
<code>plural</code> should now work correctly for "day" and "boss" and
          "medicine," but it probably doesn't yet work correctly for the word
          "box"
          <img alt="suffix s box (with wrong result)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-box-with-(wrong)-result.png" title="suffix s box (with wrong result)"/>.
          <p>
            Edit your <code>plural</code> block to make it work for words that
            end with x. <em>Test</em> it to make sure it does work properly.
          </p>
</li>
<li>
          Use <code>map</code> to test <em>all</em> the words on your list.
          <img alt="map-plural-over-list-of-nouns" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/map-plural-over-list-of-nouns.png"/>
<p>
            For now, don't worry about the words it still gets wrong, as long as
            it still works for "day," "boss," "medicine," "box."
          </p>

          Experiment with<br/>

          If you know another language, build a block that takes a pronoun and

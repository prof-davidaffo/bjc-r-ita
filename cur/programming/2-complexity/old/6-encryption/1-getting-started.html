<li>
          On a sheet of paper, make up a message to send to a partner. Invent
          some way of encoding the message, then send the encoded message to
          your partner.
        </li>
<li>
          When you get your partner's encoded message, try to decode it. What
          strategies are you using to decode the message?
        </li>
<li>
          Get together with another pair of students and compare the methods you
          used to encode your messages. Was anyone able to decode their message?
          How did they do it?

<h2>Clicking Points to Capture Coordinates</h2>
<!--         -->
<div class="learn">
      On the previous pages, you drew a shape based on a list of points you were
      given. <strong>On this page,</strong> you will automate the process of
      getting coordinates by clicking on the desired points on the screen.

        we just sketch the letters on the screen, and then click on the corners?

<span>Jasmine:</span> Umm, I think they won't like us drawing on the
        screen. But we could find a picture of what we want to trace and import
        it as a stage background. We'll have to write a block that keeps waiting
        for a mouse click, and then adds those mouse coordinates to a list. When
        all the points have been entered, the block should report the list of
        points.<br/>

                The <code>stamp</code> block is built into Snap<em>!</em>. It

<strong>Think and write: </strong><em>Read</em> the code inside the
          <code>list of points</code> reporter, and try to understand its
          structure. For example:
          <ul>
<li>
              Why is it a reporter? Since it draws the shape as you click on its
              corners, isn't the job done? Why should it report a value?
            </li>
<li>
              It uses a <code>forever</code> block. When, and how, does it
              report a value?
            </li>
<li>What is the <code>if else</code> block testing, and why?</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Test your block several times and debug any problems.</li>
<li>
          Try saving the output of <code>list of points</code> in a global
          variable and using your <code>draw points</code> to recreate the shape
          you drew. Debug any problems.

<strong>Abstraction:</strong> Notice how convenient it is to have
            <code>point</code>, <code>y coordinate of</code>,
            <code>go to point</code>, <code>draw from point to point</code>,
            etc., already built to use the <strong>point</strong> abstract data
            type. Once you've created a point from the mouse coordinates, you
            never have to think about coordinates again in this activity.

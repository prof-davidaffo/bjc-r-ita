<h2>Plurals, Continued</h2>

<p>
      Now you will improve your <code>plural</code> block so that it works
      correctly with more words. If you do not already have it, please reload
      it. (The suggested file name was <code>U2Lab1-Plural</code>.)

<strong>Abstraction: </strong> Make a
          <img alt="plural" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_h.png"/>
          block that "specializes" on just one category, words that end with the
          letter <strong>h</strong>.
          <ul>
<li>
              Start with a <code>list</code> of the words you want it to work
              for.
            </li>
<li>
              This specialist block should work correctly for words that fit its
              specialty

<img alt="suffix s (for words ending in h) with result for moth" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_h-moth-with-result.png"/>,
              <img alt="plural (for words ending in h) with result" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_h-bush-with-result.png"/>. It can be completely wrong about words that <em>don't</em> fit
              its specialty
              <img alt="plural (for words ending with h) with wrong result for mouse (wrong input) " src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_h-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png"/>
              because the <code>plural</code> block should never give words to
              <code>plural-h</code> unless those words end with
              <strong>h</strong>.

              with a variety of words to make sure it works the way you want.
              Then use <code>map</code> to test it on the entire
              <code>list </code> you made earlier.

<strong>Abstraction: </strong> English is complicated and has a lot
            of special cases. To pluralize some nouns, you add <em>s</em>; to
            some you add <em>es</em>; nouns like <em>calf</em> and
            <em>fly</em> become <em>calves</em> and <em>flies</em>, changing
            their final letters before adding <em>es</em>. And there are other
            special cases to handle. For a programming task this complex, it is
            (generally) best to break it into parts, handle each part separately
            with its own procedure (its own block), and then have the
            "top-level" block—in this case, <code>plural</code>, itself—show
            only the outline. That is, instead of coding every little detail
            directly in <code>plural</code>, it is cleaner and clearer to build
            a block that looks something like this, with each special case
            handled by block that specializes in that case only.

            <em>structure</em> of the method—just the overall strategy—in the
            "top-level" block and relegating the details to separate blocks is
            one part of an important computer science idea called
            <strong>abstraction</strong>. This aspect of abstraction is
            extremely helpful in keeping your code clear and helping you debug
            it.

<li>
          When you trust your new specialist block, edit your original
          <code> plural</code> block to use your new specialist. Test your
          revised <code>plural</code> block (you can use <code>map</code>) to
          make sure it still works for all the words it used to work for, as
          well as the new ones.
        </li>
<li>
          Take the next step. Create <code>plural-y</code> to handle words like
          this.
          <img alt="plural_y-tray-with-result" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_y-tray-with-result.png"/>

</li>
<p>
          As before, this specialist can make mistakes if it is asked to do a
          job that isn't its specialty.
          <img alt="plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural_y-mouse-with-(wrong)result.png"/>
</p>
<p>
          Make sure that <code>plural</code> gives it only the cases it knows
          how to handle correctly.
        </p>

<div class="takeItFurther">
<ol type="A">
<li>
          Because you know what
          <img alt="keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list.png"/>
          does, you can, if you like, use just <em>that</em> specialized list as
          input to a test of plural or plural-h, this way.<img alt="map-plural(with-input)-over-(keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/map-plural(with-input)-over-(keep-items-such-that-(last-letter-of-(input)-equals-h)-from-test-list).png"/>
</li>
<li>
          Extend <code>plural</code> to handle another special case. Use a
          special-purpose block for your special case to keep
          <code>plural</code> from becoming cluttered.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Surprise! </strong>Right now, if <code>plural</code> is given
          a word with a space at the end, it leaves that space in the plural,
          like this:
          <img alt="plural of bulldog with space at the end, and result with space before s" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldog[space]s).png"/>. Figure out how to handle this special case and edit
          <code>plural</code> so that the result is
          <img alt="plural of bulldog with space at the end, and correct result, no space before s" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[space]-with-result(bulldogs).png"/>? You already have a block that <em>specializes</em> in making
          plurals of words that <em>don't</em> have a space at the end.
          <em>Use</em> it.
        </li>
<li>
          Once <code>plural</code> works for a single space at the end of a
          word, try giving it
          <img alt="plural of bulldog with four spaces at the end" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/plural-bulldog[four-spaces].png"/>. <strong>Challenge: </strong>Explain why that works!

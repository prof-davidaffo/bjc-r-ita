<h2>Input Types (Teacher's Choice)</h2>


<div class="ifTime" id="first">
<ol>
<li>
          On page 2, you created a block <code> max of (x) and (y)</code> that
          reports which of its two inputs is the greater number (the maximum).
          Load that block now or quickly recreate it.<br/>
<img alt="animation of max of A and B, showing results" class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/max-of-a-and-b.gif"/>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
      The <code>max</code> block has an unexpected behavior. It is intended to
      work only for numbers, yet you can type text into it!
      <img alt="Max of cat and dog outputs dog" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/max-of-cat-dog-output.png"/>
</p>
<p>
      You have already used
      <img alt="is input a number" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/is-5-a-number.png"/>
      to <em>check</em> for situations like this. You can also define blocks to
      <em>show</em> what the expected input type is (number, text, etc.).
    </p>
<div class="ifTime">
<ol start="2">
<img alt="Editing input 'x'" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/sys/edit-input-variable-x-BYOB.jpg"/>
<li>
          Edit the <code>max</code> block. In the editor, click on the input
          name <code>x</code>.
          <div class="sidenote">
            You can also specify a <em>default</em> value for the variable if
            you like. This is how the <code>move</code> block was defined always
            to start as
            <img alt="move 10 steps" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/move-10-steps.png"/>
            with the default value 10, and not just
            <img alt="move steps" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/move-steps.png"/>
            with no default value specified.
          </div>
          Then, click the right-arrow in the pop-up box. The dialog lets you
          choose the input type you want. Click the Number slot. The
          <em>shape</em> of the slot tells people what type of input the block
          expects.<br/>
<img alt="Input Type" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/x-long-dialog.png" title="Input Type" width="420"/><br/>
          Change both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to take only numbers and
          to have the default values of 5 and 10. You will see this in the Block
          Editor.
          <div class="sidenote">
            The variable <em>names</em> are still <code>x</code> and
            <code>y</code>, even though the block's title line looks different.
            The # indicates that the input should be a number; the "= 5" shows
            the default value.
          </div>
<p>
<img alt="'max' block with defaults" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/block_editor-max-block.png" width="420"/>
</p>
<p>
            When you click OK, your block should look like this
            <img alt="max of 5 and 10" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/blocks/max of 5 and 10.png"/>. You can no longer type text as input.
          </p>
</li>
<div class="takeNote">
<p>
            When an input type is restricted, a block can still receive improper
            values.
            <img alt="max of true and 10" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/max-of-true-and-10.png"/>
<span class="snap">snap</span> doesn't constantly check to see what
            types are passed as values. Specifying the input type is an
            organizational tool to remind <em>you</em> what the domain (input
            values) of your blocks should be.
          </p>
<p>
            If you have a job writing computer programs that do something people
            rely on, a lot of the effort goes into making sure all your inputs
            are of the correct type. This can get complicated; maybe the input
            has to be a <em>positive</em> number; maybe it has to be a positive
            number that's a multiple of 1/100 (i.e., an amount expressed in
            dollars, but a whole number of cents). It's not unusual for the
            error-checking code to be longer than the part of the program that
            actually does the work. But in this course it's generally okay to
            ignore possible input errors, as long as your programs work
            correctly for <em>correct</em> inputs. We want to keep you focused
            on the interesting parts of the projects.

          and <code>integer?</code> to restrict their input values to numbers.

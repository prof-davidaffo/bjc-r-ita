<strong>You have a choice.</strong> Some of the problems below are about
      language or linguistics, some are about mathematics, and some are about
      art. <strong>Choose any three </strong>that interest you and do them.

<strong>Art idea:</strong> The code

          does not do what you might expect, because the "ends of the lines" are
          rounded. Try it.<br/>
          Now <code>clear</code> the stage and try

          Why does <em>that</em> happen?

            If you switch to "Flat line ends" for this project, you will

          Artists use tools: brushes, cameras, pencils, computers. Asking a
          computer to paint some random picture may not be art, but when
          <em>you</em> have designed the algorithm, tested it, changed it until
          you like how it works, and <em>selected</em> your favorite examples,
          <em>you are being the artist</em>. The computer is then just the tool.

<strong>Mondrian art project:</strong> The Dutch artist Piet Mondrian
          is possibly best known for his artwork using brightly colored
          rectangles.
          <p>
<img alt="Tableau_I,_by_Piet_Mondriaan, from Wikimedia Commons" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/tableau-1-piet-mondrian.png" width="300"/>
            "Tableau 1" by Piet Mondrian
          </p>
<p>
            Mondrian wasn't at all random in his choice of colors and locations,
            but even some random choices can be interesting. A
            <span class="snap">snap</span> script can produce designs like
            these.
          </p>

<div class="sidenote">
            This isn't the actual Snap<em>!</em> program. You could write custom
            blocks with these names, but they're a little verbose to use as real
            block names, especially that two-line one in the middle. This
            algorithm is for you to read, not for a computer to read.
          </div>
          This algorithm produced those designs:<br/>
<img alt="Draw outer frame (400 x 300); Fill with some color; Repeat many times; Pick random location, Pick random height and width for a rectangle that, at that location, won't extend beyond frame; Draw rectangle boundary in thick black line; Fill rectangle with random color" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/mondrian-script.png" title="Draw outer frame (400 x 300); Fill with some color; Repeat many times; Pick random location, Pick random height and width for a rectangle that, at that location, won't extend beyond frame; Draw rectangle boundary in thick black line; Fill rectangle with random color"/><br/>
          To keep your code clear, you may want to create separate blocks that
          specialize in boundary and fill and choosing locations and calculating
          size.<br/>
<div class="takeNote">
<div class="sidenoteBig">
              If you've been working with the version of this project that uses
              Snap<em>!</em>'s <code>fill</code> block, you can find that
              version
              <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/old/old-script-variables/mondrian-details.html">here</a>. Although, some people have found the way that block works to be
              frustrating for this project.
            </div>
            One way to make a <code>fill with random color</code> block is:
            <br/>
<img alt="Repeat until height or width is less than 2; Draw rectangle of specified height and width; Set height slightly smaller; Set width slightly smaller" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/fill-script.png" title="Repeat until height or width is less than 2; Draw rectangle of specified height and width; Set height slightly smaller; Set width slightly smaller"/><br/>
            Another way is to draw a single line with a very wide width (using
            "flat line ends" from the Snap<em>!</em> Settings menu) and then
            drawing a rectangle around it.
          </div>
<div class="endnote">
            To get bright colors, use <code>set pen shade to 100</code>. You can
            get a good collection of colors with:

<!--<li>Click on this image to load a script that is the outline of the algorithm that produced those designs. <div class="sidenoteBig">This list says what each block that you must edit and define should do. Think about when you want  pen up and pen down.
                                <ul>
                                <li><code>draw outer frame</code> uses a thick pen size to draw a black rectangle of the size you want for your work of art.</li>
                                    <li><code>fill with random color</code> sets  sprite inside that rectangle, sets  a random color, and uses Snap<em>!</em>'s <code>fill</code> block to color the rectangle.</li>
                                    <li>Choose <code>repeat</code>'s number (yourself) to say how many colorful rectangles. </li>
                                    <li><code>go to random location</code> could use <code>go to x: y:</code>.</li>
                                    <li><code>set height</code> and <code>set width</code> should use <code>pick random</code>, but with limits based on Sprite's location, so the colorful rectangles fit in the frame. </li>
                                    <li>Draw a rectangle of the height and width you calculated.</li>

                            </div> 
                            It is an &quot;outline&quot; because most of the blocks have no scripts in them. You will have to edit them to tell them how to do their job. 
                            <p>This script uses two blocks that you may not have used before. When you draw a rectangle with <code>draw rectangle</code>, you will need to give it values for the <var>height</var> and <var>width</var>. The <code>script variables</code> block tells the computer it must keep track of two variables, and it gives those variables the name you want them to have. The <code>set</code> block lets you <em>set</em> the values of those variables. In this case, you'll have to write some code that gives them reasonable values that change randomly, but don't run over the edge of the outer frame.</p>

            code:</strong>
          You will create an encoder/decoder with <code>for</code>,
          <code>length of</code>, <code>letter of</code>, <code>join</code>, the
          <code>unicode</code> blocks.
          <ol>
<li>
              In order to do this, you will need to be able to change a letter
              into a number, add 1 to that number, and then change the new
              number back to a letter. The Snap<em>!</em> blocks
              <img alt="unicode-of(Y)" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/unicode-of-y.png"/>
              and
              <img alt="unicode(89)as-letter" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/unicode(89)as-letter.png"/>
              will help you do that. Experiment with them to see how they work.
            </li>
<li>
              Create a block <code>encode</code> that takes a word as input,
              changes each letter into the <em>next</em> letter in the
              alphabet—for example, A becomes B, Y becomes Z...—and reports the
              result, like this:

            </li>
<li>
              When you give <code>encode</code> the input <code>z</code>, what

<strong>Linguistic research:</strong> Build a block that takes text as

          to take a chunk of text and figure out the frequency of each letter.

<strong>A mathematical function: </strong>Create<a class="anchor" name="factorial"> </a>a <code>factorial</code> block
          <img alt="n factorial" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/n-factorial.png"/>
          (or
          <img alt="n!" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/n-factorial-symbol.png"/>) that takes a positive integer <em>n</em> and reports the product
          of all whole numbers from 1 through <em>n</em>, in other words 1
          × 2 × 3 × ... × (<em>n</em> - 1) ×
          <em>n</em>. When the input is 4, the output should be 24 (because 1 ×

              Dividing 5! by 4!, the result should be 5

              because 5 factorial is really just 5 times 4 factorial. Using your
              block, check each of these computations—<img alt="4-factorial-divided-by-3-factorial" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/4-factorial-divided-by-3-factorial.png"/>,

              <img alt="1-factorial-divided-by-0-factorial" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/1-factorial-divided-by-0-factorial.png"/>—to see what it reports. One of these is inconsistent with
              the others. To fix the problem, we need to <em>define</em> 0! = 1.
              Edit your <code>n!</code> block to report 1 if <em>n</em> = 0.
              Then fully test <code>n!</code> again to make sure it works as it

              should not work. Check to see what does happen. Then edit your
              block and find a way to use
              <img alt="is n a number" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/is-n-a-number.png"/>
              to check that the input is a number and report some sensible
              result or message.

<li>
<strong>Analyzing code: </strong>In mathematics, factorial is
              defined only for positive integers and zero, so 3.7! would make no
              mathematical sense. But
              <img alt="three-point-seven-factorial" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/three-point-seven-factorial.png"/>
              reports a result. Find out what it reports and analyze what the
              block does so that you can figure out why <em>that</em> is the
              result.
            </li>

<li>
<strong>Two other mathematical functions:</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>
              Create a block <code>triangular number n</code> that
              <em>adds</em> all of the whole numbers from 1 through
              <em>n</em>:<span class="katex-block">1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n - 1) + n</span>
              When its input is 4, your block should report 10 (that is, 1 + 2 +
              3 + 4). Define your block so that
              <code> triangular number 0</code> reports 0.

              so that
              <img alt="sum from 3 to 7" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/sum-from3to7-170x27.png"/>
              reports the sum 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7, and
              <img alt="sum from -3 to 3" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/sum-from-3to3.png"/>
              reports the sum of -3 + -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3.

            Recall that <code>n mod i</code> will tell you if <em>i</em> is a

<strong>Counting divisors: </strong>Create a block that takes a whole
          number as input and checks numbers from 1 through that input and
          counts the ones that evenly divide the input. So, for example,
          <img alt="number of divisors of 8, with result = 4" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/2-complexity/number-of-divisors-of-8-with-result(4).png"/>
          because, from 1 through 8, only the numbers 1, 2, 4, and 8 evenly
          divide 8. <code>number-of-divisors 10</code> should also report 4
          because, of the numbers from 1 through 10, only 1, 2, 5, and 10 are
          divisors of 10. <strong>Experiment</strong> to find several numbers
          that have an odd number of divisors.

<strong>Old-fashioned divisibility test—divisibility by 3 or 9:

<ul>
<li>
              Create a helper reporter <code>digit sum</code> that adds up the
              digits in a number. So, for example
              <code>digit sum 7</code> should report 7, and
              <code>digit sum 12</code> should report 3, and
              <code>digit sum 126</code> should report 9 (the sum of 1, 2 and
              6). You may find these blocks useful.

</li>
<li>
              Then write <code>repeated digit sum</code>, which keeps taking the
              <code>digit sum</code> until the result is a single digit. For
              example, the digit sum of 238 is 2+3+8=13, which is more than a
              single digit. The digit sum of 13 is 1+3=4, which <em>is</em> a
              single digit. So the repeated digit sum of 238 is 4.

              Write predicates <code>divisible by 3?</code> and
              <code>divisible by 9?</code>. A number is divisible by 3 if its
              repeated digit sum is 0, 3, 6, or 9; it's divisible by 9 if its
              digit sum is 0 or 9.

<strong>Old-fashioned divisibility test—divisibility by 7: </strong>
          Create a <code>multiples of 7 algorithm</code> block that takes any
          whole number as input and then puts it through this process:
          
<div class="endnote">

            and

            Test it first on several multiples of 7 (small and large) and make
            sure that, for multiples of 7, it reports only the results 14, 7, 0,
            -7, and -14. Also test it on several numbers that are
            <em>not</em> multiples of 7; for those numbers, it should never
            report 14, 7, 0, -7, or -14.

          Look up a test for divisibility by 11 or 13 and see if you can build a
          block that performs that algorithm.

<div class="endnote">
          In <span class="snap">snap</span>, as in most programming languages,
          you can test for divisibility just by using <code>mod</code>, but
          before computers were widespread, algorithms like these greatly
          simplified some computations.

        <img src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/converse.png" alt="conversation with ASK AND WAIT" />
<p>Note that this script has <em>two </em>script variables. The <code>script variables</code> block has a little right-arrow at the end:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/arrowhead.png" alt="arrowhead in block" />
        <p>If you click the arrowhead, a second orange variable oval will appear. Also, there will be left- and right-facing arrowheads. You can click these to adjust the number of variables you need.</p>
        <p>The join block also has arrowheads to control the number of input slots it has. In the text string inputs, both in <code>join</code> and in the <code>ask</code> blocks, the pale brown raised dots represent spaces. The brown dots don&rsquo;t appear in the text on the stage when the script is run. They&rsquo;re in the input slots so that you can easily see if there are multiple spaces in a row:</p>
        <img src="/bjc-r-ita/img/prog/multispace.png" alt="text input with multiple spaces in a row" />
        <p>and also so that you can distinguish between a completely empty input slot and one that has a space in it:</p>

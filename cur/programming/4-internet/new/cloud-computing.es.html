<h3>Cloud Storage</h3>

<p>
      Locally (on your computer), the binary sequences that make up data are
      temporarily stored in RAM and are stored long-term on your hard drive, but
      they can also be stored in the cloud. "The cloud" just means "somewhere on
      the Internet but you don't really know where." You have been using the
      cloud throughout this whole course. All of your Snap<em>!</em> projects
      are stored in the cloud; they aren't on your local computer. That's why
      you have to log in to access your projects. Similarly, if you use Google
      Drive or Dropbox, all of those files are stored in the cloud. And if you
      use a web-based email service (such as Gmail or Yahoo), your emails are
      stored in the cloud.

<strong>: the cloud</strong>
<p>
        You can store your data (photos, music, videos, text, etc.) either
        <em>locally</em> (on your computer) or in
        <em><strong>the cloud</strong></em>. Storing data in the cloud means storing <em>somewhere</em> on the
        Internet, but you don't have to worry about where—the cloud
        service provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, Snap!, etc) manages the actual
        storage location.
      </p>
<hr/>
<p>
        Some applications run in the cloud and never get downloaded to or
        installed on your computer at all (like Snap<em>!</em>).

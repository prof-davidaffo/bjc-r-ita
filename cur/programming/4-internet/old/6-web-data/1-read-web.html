<h2>Reading HTML with Snap<em>!</em> (Teacher's Choice)</h2>

<p>The Internet is full of information that you can use in your programs.  </p>
<div class="endnote">For example, you could code an <img alt="umbrella? predicate" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/4-internet/umbrella.png" title="umbrella? predicate"/> block that looks up the weather forecast for your location (based on your IP address) and tells you whether or not to carry an umbrella. Or you could build a <code>current temperature</code> block that reports the current temperature for the given location:<br/><img alt="current temperature in (New York) reporting 34" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/4-internet/current-temp-34.png" title="current temperature in (New York) reporting 34"/></div>
<div class="ifTime">

<li><img alt="Talk with Your Partner" class="imageRight" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png" title="Talk with Your Partner"/> Load <a class="run" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/4-internet/old/U4L6-HttpBlock.xml">this project</a>, and click on the <img alt="http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/4-internet/http-reporting.png" title="http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)"/> block. What does the <code>http</code> block is report?</li>
<div class="endnote">
                    Be sure <em>not</em> to include the "http://" in the input slot. That's already included as part of the <code>http</code> block.<br/>
<img alt="Don't include the 'http://' in the http block input slot." class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/4-internet/http-http.png" title="Don't include the 'http://' in the http block input slot.">
</img></div>
<li>Open <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">http://snap.berkeley.edu</a> for reference. Can you find any correspondences between the actual webpage and the code that the <code>http</code> block reports?<br/></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>You probably saw the page <em>title</em> (the text up at the very top of the browser window) but not much else that looks familiar. Like most web pages, this one starts with a specification of the page format (things like the margin space to the left and right of the page text); the actual contents of the page is further inside it.</p>
<p>
            There are two custom <code>substring</code> blocks included in this project that allow you to select subsections of a text string. (What we've been calling a "text" is also called a <strong>text string</strong> or just a <strong>string</strong>.) They each report only a portion of a string:
            <ul>
<li>
                    The <code>substring starting with</code> block reports the part that <em>starts with</em> (and including) the text you enter in the input slot.
                  <img alt="substring of (This is an example of the substring blocks.) starting with (example) reporting 'example of the substring blocks.'" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/4-internet/substring-starting-with-reporting.png" title="substring of (This is an example of the substring blocks.) starting with (example) reporting 'example of the substring blocks.'"/>
</li>
<li>
                    The <code>substring up to</code> block reports only the part <em>up to</em> (but <em>not</em> including) the text you enter in the input slot.
                  <img alt="substring of (This is an example of the substring blocks.) up to (example) reporting 'This is an '" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/4-internet/substring-up-to-reporting.png" title="substring of (This is an example of the substring blocks.) up to (example) reporting 'This is an '"/>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
            You can use these two blocks together to report a specific piece of text on the page.<br/>
<img alt="substring of (substring of (http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)) starting with(You get a)) up to (&lt;/section&gt;)" class="indent" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/4-internet/youget.png" title="substring of (substring of (http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)) starting with(You get a)) up to &lt;/section&gt;"/><br/>

<li>Why is the word "also" in <em>italics</em> on the web site?</li>

                	Use the <code>substring starting with</code> and <code>substring up to</code> blocks to create a reporter that uses the output of <img alt="http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)" class="inline" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/4-internet/http-reporting.png" title="http:// (snap.berkeley.edu)"/> to create a <code>most recent version of Snap!</code> reporter.

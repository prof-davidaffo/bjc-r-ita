<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page</strong>, you will learn about how data on the
        Internet is measured and stored.
      </p>

<ul>
<li>
          A <strong>bit</strong> is the smallest unit of data, which can only
          have one of two values (such as a 1 or 0).
        </li>
<li>
          The <strong>bit rate</strong> of a connection is the numbers of bits
          of data that can sent in a second.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Bandwidth</strong> is the transmission capacity of a system
          (for digital data, it is measured by bit rate). Higher bandwidth is
          better; the data will travel more quickly.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Latency</strong> is time between the transmission and the
          receipt of a message. Lower latency is better; the data will take less
          time to <em>start</em> transmitting.
        </li>
</ul>

<p>
          Think of a disk drive inside a computer. In order to send information
          to or from the disk, the computer has to physically move the magnetic
          head to the place on the disk where that information lives and then
          wait for the disk to spin to the correct position, all of which can
          take more than a second. That delay is the <em>latency</em>. But once
          the head is in the right place, the <em>bandwidth</em> of the disk is
          very fast.
        </p>

<p>
      The speed of a system (such as the bandwidth and latency of the Internet)
      affects how we use it. In the early days of the Internet, bandwidth was
      slow, so people couldn't send video (only text and small pictures).
      Streaming video requires higher bandwidth, but it can tolerate higher
      latency. If your Internet connection has high latency, then when you
      stream a video, your computer will buffer (download ahead of time) several
      seconds of video before it starts playing it so that it doesn't have to
      pause when it runs out of data.
    </p>
<p>
      The size of a system also affects how it's used. In the early days of
      computing, computers were huge and expensive, so people went to the
      computer center at their local university or business to do their
      computations. As computers became smaller and more efficient, centralized
      computer centers became much less important because people could do
      computations on personal machines. More recently, however, certain kinds
      of computation (such as web searches and voice recognition) require more
      computational power, and these tasks are instead sent to huge computer
      "farms" run by companies such as Google and Amazon, where tens of
      thousands of computers work together on a problem. You still have a
      computer at your desk (or in your hand), but some of its programs actually
      run on a group of computers at one of these centralized farms.
    </p>
<p>
      These computer farms, all together, are referred to as <em>the cloud</em>.
      You have been using the cloud throughout this course: all of your Snap<em>!</em>
      projects are stored in the cloud.
    </p>
<div class="endnote">
      Your Snap<em>!</em> projects aren't stored on your local computer. That's
      why you have to log in to access your projects. Similarly, if you use
      Google Drive or Dropbox, all of those files are stored in the cloud. And
      if you use a web-based email service (such as Gmail or Yahoo), your emails
      are stored in the cloud.
    </div>
<div class="vocabFullWidth">
<p>
        Storing data in <strong>the cloud</strong> means storing it
        <em>somewhere</em> on the Internet, but you don't know where. The cloud
        service provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, Snap<em>!</em>, etc.) manages
        the actual storage location.
      </p>
</div>

<p>
      Storing data in the cloud offers allows us to share and collaborate on our
      work, but it does increase the security risks. If someone discovers your
      password, for example, they can use it to access your data. Or data might
      be intercepted while it is being sent back and forth to the cloud.

          Come up with an example of an application that is influenced by the
          Internet's latency and bandwidth. Explain how the speed of the

          with your team. You might consider the following options:
          <ul>
<li>Detect spam by finding phone numbers or web links</li>
<li>
              Detect spam by finding words that are highly frequent in spam
              messages and not in ham messages
            </li>
<li>
              Detect spam by checking with a dictionary for clean spelling and
              no abbreviations
            </li>
<li>Combine several methods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How hard would it be to implement your solutions?</li>
<li>
          Compare your solutions with the one you wrote earlier (using average
          number of words)? Which would do better? Why?

<h2>Analyzing GPS Data</h2>

<p>Big Burgers wants to answer this key question: <em>where should the new restaurant be?</em> By visualizing the 223 data points, they've learned new information about their customers.</p>
<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">
<ol>
<li>Download <a download="" href="/bjc-r-ita/prog/4-internet/old/average.xml">this library with an <code>average</code> block</a>, and import it into your U4L2-GPSData project.</li>

<li>Use the <code>average</code> block to compute the average latitude and average longitude of the GPS data.</li>
<li>Plot the average as a new data point using the same scaling as the other points.</li>
<li>Would this be a good location for the restaurant? Explain.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Here's a visualization of the GPS data, along with some latitude lines for reference. The GPS data breaks into three clear zones:</p>

<p>
            Based on the visualization, Big Burgers will place their restaurant in the zone with the largest number of customers. But, which one is it?
            <div class="sidenote">Taking a large data set and breaking it into smaller groups is called <strong>cluster analysis</strong>. Visualizations of data are especially helpful in identifying and classifying clusters.</div>
</p>
<div class="forYouToDo">
<ol start="5">
<li>Given a specific pair of GPS coordinates, how might you decide which of the three zones it is in?</li>
<li>Create a <code>zone</code> block. The input is a pair of GPS coordinates, and the output indicates which zone the coordinates are in.</li>
<li>Use the <code>zone</code> block and the full set of GPS data to determine which of the three zones has the most customers.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Now that Big Burgers knows the general area to place the restaurant, they still need to determine where <em>within that zone</em> to place it. To do this, they need a new list of the GPS coordinates of those customers within that zone.</p>

<li>Use the <code>average</code> block to compute the average of all the longitudes and latitudes of the GPS data <strong>within the most popular zone</strong>.</li>
<li>On a map, find the location where the data says the restaurant should be located. What practical limitations might there be to this analysis?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Search Engines</h2>

<div class="learn">
<p>
<strong>On this page,</strong> you will learn about search engines and
        consider whether it matters which tools you use to search the web.
      </p>

<div class="forYouToDo" id="first">

<li>
          Open the search engine you usually use, the
          <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" title="duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>
          search engine, and another search engine such as
          <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank" title="google.com">Google</a>,
          <a href="http://yahoo.com" target="_blank" title="yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, or
          <a href="http://bing.com" target="_blank" title="bing.com">Bing</a>.
          Search for a phrase, like "Internet search engines" or "New York
          restaurants." Do you get the same search results at each site? Try a
          search related to politics, such as "Barack Obama."
        </li>
<!--                <li>Read <a href="http://dontbubble.us" target="_blank" title="dontbubble.us">dontbubble.us</a>.</li> (stale link, alas) -->
<li>
          Discuss with a partner, then share with the class. How do you think a
          search engine works? What algorithm might the search engine use to
          decide what to show you?
        </li>
<li>
          Search results are different in different countries, even from the
          same search engine. Investigate the reasons for this. (To start, do a
          web search for "search censorship.")
        </li>
<li>
          In
          <a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter4.pdf" target="_blank" title="Blown to Bits"><em>Blown to Bits</em></a>, the authors claim that "search is a new form of control over
          information" (p. 111) and "search is power" (p. 145). Why might it be
          important to think of the social implications behind searching on the
          Internet?

        Jerry Yang (born 1968) is best known as the co-founder and former CEO of
        Yahoo Inc. Yang’s family immigrated to America from Taiwan when he was
        ten years old. Although at that time he only knew one English word,
        "shoe", Yang went on to graduate with a BS and a MS in electrical
        engineering from Stanford University. While studying at Stanford, Yang
        co-created an Internet website which acted as a directory of other
        websites. Eventually named Yahoo!, this website became the most popular
        search engine and starting point for web users by 1998. In 2016, Yahoo!
        was sold to Verizon for $5 Billion.

          Google keeps track of searches. You can check out

          tracking? What are benefits and costs to individual users from this
          tracking?

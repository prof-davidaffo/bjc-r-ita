<h2>Cryptosecurity</h2>

<p>
      Cryptography is the study of how to convert messages into code
      (encryption) and how to solve codes (decryption). Just as TCP enables
      reliable transmission over an unreliable network, cryptography enables
      verifiable, secure transmission over an insecure network.

        Symmetric cryptography has been around for thousands of years. The
        trouble with symmetric cryptography is: how can we keep the key secret?

        was created by mathematicians in the 1970s. It uses
        <em>two different keys</em> for encryption and decryption, so sharing
        the public encryption key doesn't give away the private decryption key.

      Banks use public key cryptography. When users enter their password on a
      bank's web site, the user's browser uses the bank's public key to encrypt
      the password before sending it over the Internet. Only the bank can
      decrypt that password, using their private key.

<h3>Secure HTTP</h3>
<p>
      Secure HTTP connections (those that use <strong>https://</strong> instead
      of <strong>http://</strong>) use a protocol called
      <strong>Transport Layer Security</strong> (TLS) or maybe an older version
      called <strong>Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (SSL). Both are based on
      public key cryptography. With <strong>SSL/TLS</strong>, the site you are
      visiting sends its public key, and your browser uses it to encrypt the
      information you send. The end of this video you've seen before describes
      these protocols.

<h3 class="box-head">Open Standards Help Security</h3>
<p>
        In order to work properly, a cryptographic function has to be easy for
        the private key holder to invert, but hard for anyone else to invert.
        How do we know what "hard" means? For example, current
        cryptographic methods rely on the difficulty of finding prime factors of
        very large numbers. There's no <em>proof</em> that someone won't come up
        with a fast way to do that, but people are pretty confident about it
        because the problem has been well studied by many mathematicians. (On
        the other hand, when <em>quantum computers</em> become practical,
        factorization <em>will</em> be easy, and new cryptographic methods will
        be needed.)
      </p>
<p>
        What makes it possible for mathematicians to study the difficulty of
        breaking Internet cryptography is that the method used—the
        cryptographic function—is openly published. This may seem strange;
        if you want to keep secrets, shouldn't you keep the technique secret,
        too? But secret algorithms can have weaknesses that go undiscovered
        until some bad guy exploits them. Open standards allow an algorithm to
        be studied <em>before</em> it is used in practice.
      </p>

<h3>Certificate Authorities</h3>
<p>
      Public key cryptography doesn't solve all the problems, because someone
      might publish a fake public key pretending to be someone (say, Alice).
      Then someone might accidentally encrypt their message for Alice using the
      faker's key, and then the faker can read the message. In practice, this is
      partly fixed by relying on trusted third parties, called
      <strong>Certificate Authorities</strong>, to <em>issue public keys</em>.
      In your browser's security options you can see all of the Certificate
      Authorities that it trusts.

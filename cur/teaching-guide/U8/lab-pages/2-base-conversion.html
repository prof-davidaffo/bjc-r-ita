<h2>Lab 2: Base Conversion</h2>
<p>
      Students build a block to display a number in a specified base. The work
      begins in base 2 and extends to any base, and also involves converting
      back to base 10. While this problem can be solved using iteration, the
      recursive solution is more elegant.

<h3>Pacing</h3>

<div>
      The 2 lab pages could be split across 1–2 days (<strong>45–90 minutes</strong>). Expected times to complete follow:
      <ul>
<li>
          15–30 minutes (&lt; class period) on
          <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/2-base-conversion/1-binary-conversion.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F8-recursive-reporters.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment" title="Binary Conversion">Binary Conversion</a>
</li>
<li>
          30–60 minutes (about 1 class periods) on
          <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/8-recursive-reporters/2-base-conversion/2-base-conversion.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F8-recursive-reporters.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment" title="Base Conversion">Base Conversion</a>

<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
                  Some students may get confused by the word
                  <strong>base</strong> here, thinking it connects to
                  <strong>base cases</strong>. These are two different uses of
                  the same word.
                </li>
<li>
                  Give students a chance to try the binary conversion problem
                  directly, but chances are they will need the hints from the
                  second page. Solutions that students construct without the
                  hints are often iterative instead of recursive. Some students
                  also find the general base conversion problem (or a specific
                  one like base 7) to be easier than binary conversion, so if a
                  student continues to be stuck, switch them to a different
                  base.
                </li>
<li>
                  Some solutions will involve lists; students may not know about
                  the <code>list-&gt;word</code> block (added by using Import
                  tools) that can solve this problem; it is also possible to
                  write a recursive version using <code>join</code>. The
                  provided solution uses <code>join</code> as part of the
                  recursive step, so it is done as part of the process.
                </li>
<li>
                  Watch for errors in base cases when students move beyond
                  binary conversion, since more values should be part of the
                  base case. This is a common mistake.

<strong>Tips:</strong>

<li>
                  Students may need to search to find the
                  <img alt="letter (1) of (6254) reporting 6" src="/bjc-r-ita/img/8-recursive-reporters/letterblock.png" title="letter (1) of (6254) reporting 6"/>
                  block, which is very helpful for the
                  <code>from base</code> block.
                </li>
<li>
                  You can use a counter variable to keep track of the number of
                  calls if you are interested in talking about how the Base
                  Conversion algorithm is linear time.

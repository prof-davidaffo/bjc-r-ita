          You may choose to work through this project yourself before assigning
          it to students. The fourth page uses nested higher-order functions.
          Abstraction helps separate the steps, but the overall effort requires
          careful attention to the steps along the way to the final result.

                  You may find it helpful to have students write out their
                  description of these six blocks and how they work.

                  Students must understand the idea of a <em>triple</em> in this
                  program. It's not <em>any arbitrary</em> set of three squares;
                  it's a set of three squares that count as a win: a row, a
                  column, or a diagonal.
                </li>
<li>
                  The last problem is at the heart of the actual program;
                  consider having a whole-class discussion about it.
                  <code>Board</code> is the user interface's representation of
                  who has moved where on the board, a straightforward list of
                  nine squares, each of which can be X, O, or the square number
                  to indicate empty.
                  <code>Status of all winning triples</code> represents the same
                  board status, so in a sense it's redundant, but it presents
                  that information in a form that's structured for the decision
                  of the computer's move. One could say that
                  <code>board</code> is for the conversation between the user
                  and the program, while
                  <code>status of all winning triples</code> is for the program
                  thinking about its strategy.

                  Use the <code>broadcast</code> command,
                  <code>when I receive</code> event, and
                  <code>message</code> reporter to implement a computer player.

                  This page is a turning point for students. They have now
                  written a program that has goal-directed behavior, trying to
                  win at Tic-Tac-Toe. Don't let them be too caught up in coding
                  details to appreciate what they've done!

<strong>Learning Goal:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
                  Make the shift from the student's intuitive, informal
                  tic-tac-toe strategy to an explicit, formal, algorithmic set
                  of rules.
                </li>
</ul>

<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
                  On this page, students explore their tic-tac-toe strategy
                  using the program they have built, but this could also be done
                  on paper.
                </li>
<li>
                  On this page and the next, students must alternate between two
                  different points of view: (1) thinking about tic-tac-toe as a
                  game, articulating the rules they use themselves when playing;
                  (2) thinking about the problem of embodying those rules in a
                  computer program. We try to make this explicit on the page,
                  but be on the lookout for students who confuse these two
                  levels of abstraction.
                </li>
<li>
                  Creating the <code>winning triple</code> and
                  <code>winning square</code> blocks are the most challenging
                  parts of this page. Help students prepare by making sure they:
                  <ul>
<li>
                      Debug everything that comes before developing these blocks
                    </li>
<li>
                      Think through the approach they will take (as suggested on
                      the page just before they begin building
                      <code>winning triple</code>)
                    </li>
<li>
                      Review the hint about <code>winning triple</code> and the
                      page where they first learned about <code>keep</code>
</li>
</ul>
                  Encourage pairs who have done all of these things and are
                  still stuck to talk with other pairs.
                  <p>
                    You may also choose to have them each write out their
                    approach to 'determining if a player can win on their next
                    turn' individually after they discuss it and before they
                    start coding.

<h2>Experiencing Algorithms</h2>


<p>
			We're going to step away from the computer for some activities that your teacher will lead.
            <ol>
<li>You'll use numbered cups to explore different ways to search for a number in a list of numbers.</li>
<li>You'll think about ways to speed up this process.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
            Keep in mind the following questions while you are working on this activity:
            <ul>
<li>What strategies exist for finding a particular number in the fewest number of location checks?
                </li>
<li>How many guesses would it take on average to find a number?</li>
<li>How many guesses would it take to determine that a number didn't exist in the list at all?</li>
<li>How much additional work will it be to find a number if N, the highest numbered cup, were to increase?</li>
</ul>

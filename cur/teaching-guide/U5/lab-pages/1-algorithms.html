<h2>Lab 1: Search Algorithms and Efficiency</h2>
<p>In a reversal of their <a href="/bjc-r-ita/cur/programming/2-complexity/1-variables-games/3-debugging-extending.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F2-conditionals-abstraction.topic&amp;course=bjc4nyc.html&amp;novideo&amp;noassignment" title="Debugging and Extending Your Number Guessing Game">Unit 2 number guessing game</a>, students design an algorithm that identifies the player's secret number by: guessing, asking the player if the guesses are too high or too low, and guessing again until guessing right. Students use this as a basis for developing and analyzing list searching algorithms for ordered and unordered lists.</p>
<p> An efficient list searching algorithm depends on the fact that numbers have order. Searching an <em>ordered</em> list to find the location of a given object is most efficiently done with essentially the same algorithm. Searching for the location of an object in an <em>unordered</em> list cannot be done the same way. The time that it takes these two algorithms to find their objects hardly matters when the lists are small, but matters a lot when the lists get large. This is students' first experience analyzing computational complexity.</p>

<h3>Lab Pages</h3>
<div>
<ul>

<li>
<strong>Page 1: Guess My Number.</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students invent the binary search algorithm by observing their own guesses and trying to improve their play.</li>
<li>They then implement the algorithm for the computer to use while guessing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students have built the version of the game in which the human player does the guessing in Unit 2. Some will already have discovered the binary search algorithm. Indeed, some may have played the game in elementary school math class.</li>
<li>When students implement the program that lets the computer guess the human player's number, there is no scaffolding at all for the programming. We're in Unit 5, almost ready for the AP exam, and they need to have some skill at coding by now. Reassure them (and yourself) that they can do this, and refrain from giving them code. Instead, tell them to read the algorithm description they've just written.</li>
<li>By the way, they wrote the algorithm in English in the context of teaching it to another student. This is a much more natural and honest context for writing algorithms in text than talk of "pseudocode"; if you're writing an algorithm for a computer to use, the only reason not to write it directly in code is that you're using a bad programming language. But other human beings are "programmed" in English.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 2: How Many Five-Letter Words Are There?</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students will use the <code>computation time of</code> block to measure the running time of a process.</li>
<li>Students will understand what it means for a process to take linear time: The time is proportional to the size of the input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>As the page reminds them, students have already written the (one-line) function, using <code>keep</code>, to count the number of five-letter words. If they've forgotten, let them review the linked page.</li>
<li>It's important that they do problem 5 (estimate the time for a ten-times-as-long dictionary) before problem 6 (do the experiment).</li>
<li>Note that the inner green box invites students to look inside the <code>computation time of</code> block. It's a simple piece of code, won't take long to read, and may be useful in demystifying the measurement of time.</li>
<li>The block measures "wall clock time": the actual elapsed time, not the amount of time the computer actually spends running this program. Modern operating systems start roughly 100 programs when they are booted; all those programs compete with Snap<em>!</em> for computer time. That's why running the same experiment twice will generally give different answers.</li>
<li>Don't obsess over the difference between a problem and an instance of the problem, but there <em>is</em> a reason for making the distinction: An instance of the problem, working with specific inputs, takes constant time!  (Maybe a small constant, maybe a large constant, but either way it's constant.) It's only when you compare several instances of the problem that you can observe how running time varies as a function of problem size.</li>
<li><code>Keep</code> is a Snap<em>!</em> primitive, but that doesn't mean it takes constant time. <em>Most</em> primitives do take constant time (think about arithmetic operators, sprite motion, and so on), so some students may assume that <em>all</em> primitives are constant time. But even not counting higher-order functions, the <code>contains</code> predicate for lists takes linear time.</li>
<li>Don't neglect problem 7. It's not always obvious which of several sizes in a problem is the relevant one for timing computations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 3: Is "Seperate" Spelled Correctly?</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The goal of this page is for students to understand and time binary search.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The main difference between guess my number and binary search is that in the former, each number is its own position. (That is, in the numbers from 1 to 10, 3 is the third number.) So there's no need to consider the position and the value at that position separately. But in binary search of a dictionary, after computing the middle position in the list, you have to actually retrieve that item of the list with the <code>item</code> block.</li>
<li>Don't bring this up unless a student asks, but the comparison predicates, when applied to <em>numbers, don't</em> compare alphabetically; 2 comes before 12 as a number, even though in alphabetical order, "2" would be compared with <em>the first digit of</em> "12," i.e., with "1."</li>
<li>Don't bring this up, either, but if you do a binary search of a <em>linked</em> list (one that was constructed with the <code>in front of</code> function rather than by mutation) it'll take somewhat more than linear time, because each call to <code>item</code> takes linear time instead of constant time. It won't happen with the dictionaries in the starter project.</li>
<li>The "If There Is Time" project, a spell checker, is fun and useful.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 4: Exactly How Much Faster Is Binary Search?</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students will determine that binary search takes less than linear time, both by experimental measurement and by counting the number of constant-time steps required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>After students have they've made their tables, have a few students share their times and observe the variation. Then have a few students share their number of steps and observe that everyone (ideally) has the same count for the steps. This is because the number of steps is a fixed quantity, whereas the time the algorithm takes to run depends on the speed of the computer and what else it's doing at that moment.</li>
<li>Students may notice that there are actually two comparisons in every iteration for <code>binary search</code>: an <code>=</code> and a <code>&lt;</code>. We are considering that to be just one step, but if they want to count each as its own step, that's fine; they will just get twice as many steps for each list in their table.</li>
<li>If your students are old enough to have studied logarithms, you can ask them to determine the exact number of comparisons needed as a function of the list size, namely <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>)=⌈log<sub>2</sub><em>n</em>⌉. (Of course this is a worst case time; you might be lucky enough to be searching for the word exactly halfway through the list.) But if they haven't studied logs, it's not important; they should just see how dramatically lower the number of guesses is than the size of the list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 5: Categorizing Algorithms.</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Understand examples of constant time, sublinear (e.g., log) time, linear time, quadratic time, and exponential time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Because 25,000 is a big number, students may find it counterintuitive that it's in the fastest category (constant time). But this is a case in which the relevant number is, indeed, 25,000—but it's <em>always</em> 25,000. 25,000 numbers starting at 1,000,000 takes just as long as 25,000 numbers starting at 1. So the input to the function is irrelevant.</li>
<li>We provide a sort function that takes quadratic time, not the most efficient possible, because we want students to understand quadratic time. Optimal sort algorithms take <em>n</em> log <em>n</em> time.</li>
<li>The exponential-time algorithm, the one that finds values in Pascal's triangle by adding the two values above the one you want, is in an If There Is Time. But try to fit this in; the experience of measuring an exponential-time function will really give students an intuitive feel for how unreasonable an exponential-time algorithm is. Just reading about it isn't the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 6: Heuristic Solutions.</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Students will learn that some exponential-time problems have faster <em>approximate</em> or <em>good enough</em> solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We are not asking students to write a real example of a heuristic solution. So this page is entirely offline discussions or even lecture if you must.</li>
<li>The "can all decision problems be solved" part of the page introduces the topic of Lab 4: undecidable problems. It's here because the College Board only expects students to accept on faith that there are such problems, so some teachers decide to skip Lab 4, in which we prove it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 7: Removing Duplicates.</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>Distinct items</code> is another example of a quadratic time algorithm.</li>
<li>Students are guided to a recursive solution, introducing them to recursions on lists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expect some students to have trouble understanding the base case of the predicate version they write first. Are the items of an empty list distinct? There aren't any items, so students will be tempted to report False. But the right way to think about it is that there aren't any non-distinct items, so all the (nonexistent) items are indeed distinct.</li>
<li>This algorithm takes quadratic time. If you have some students who are way ahead of the class, tell them that a good rule of thumb is to see if <em>sorting</em> the data (with an <em>n</em> log <em>n</em> algorithm like the one in the "list utilities" library, not the <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> one in this lab's starter project) will allow a solution in less than quadratic time. And in this case it will, because each item has to be compared only to the one just after it, rather than to all the others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 8: Parallelism.</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Learning Goals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many problems can be solved more quickly with parallelism.</li>
<li>Even home computers these days have a small degree of parallel capability.</li>
<li>For several reasons, using <em>n</em> processors instead of one doesn't divide the runtime by <em>n.</em></li>
<li>Writing software to benefit from parallelism is hard to get right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In the examples using <code>wait</code> blocks, it's important to notice the "<code>and wait</code>" in the <code>broadcast</code> block that starts the parallel scripts; that's what makes the <code>wait</code> in the same script happen after the parallel threads have finished.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Essential Knowledge:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>AAP-2.O.1:</strong> Traversing a list can be a complete traversal, where all elements in the list are accessed, or a partial traversal, where only a portion of elements are accessed.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-2.O.5:</strong> Linear search or sequential search algorithms check each element of a list, in order, until the desired value is found or all elements in the list have been checked.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-2.P.1:</strong> The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-2.P.2:</strong> Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-2.P.3:</strong> Binary search is often more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.1:</strong> A <em>problem</em> is a general description of a task that can (or cannot) be solved algorithmically. An <em>instance</em> of a problem also includes specific input. For example, sorting is a problem; sorting the list (2,3,1,7) is an instance of the problem.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.2:</strong> A <em>decision problem</em> is a problem with a yes/no answer  (e.g., is there a path from A to B?). An <em>optimization problem</em> is a problem with the goal of finding the "best" solution among many (e.g., what is the shortest path from A to B?).</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.3:</strong> <em>Efficiency</em> is an estimation of the amount of computational resources used by an algorithm. Efficiency is typically expressed as a function of the size of the input.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.4:</strong> An algorithm's efficiency is determined through formal or mathematical reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.5:</strong> An algorithm's efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.6:</strong> Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.7:</strong> Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a <em>reasonable amount of time</em>. Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an <em>unreasonable amount of time</em>.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.8:</strong> Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficient algorithm for solving them. In these cases, approximate solutions are sought.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.A.9:</strong> A <em>heuristic</em> is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that is not guaranteed to be optimal but may be used when techniques that are guaranteed to always find an optimal solution are impractical.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.B.1:</strong> A <em>decidable problem</em> is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs (e.g., <em>Is the number even?</em>).</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.B.2:</strong> An <em>undecidable problem</em> is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.</li>
<li><strong>AAP-4.B.3:</strong> An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.A.1:</strong> <em>Sequential computing</em> is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.A.2:</strong> <em>Parallel computing</em> is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.A.3:</strong> <em>Distributed computing</em> is a computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.A.4:</strong> Comparing efficiency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes them to perform the same task.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.A.5:</strong> A sequential solution takes as long as the sum of all of its steps.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.A.6:</strong> A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.A.7:</strong> The "speedup" of a parallel solution is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.B.1:</strong> Parallel computing consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.B.2:</strong> Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.B.3:</strong> Distributed computing allows problems to be solved that could not be solved on a single computer because of either the processing time or storage needs involved.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.B.4:</strong> Distributed computing allows much larger problems to be solved quicker than they could be solved using a single computer.</li>
<li><strong>CSN-2.B.5:</strong> When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is still limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.</li>

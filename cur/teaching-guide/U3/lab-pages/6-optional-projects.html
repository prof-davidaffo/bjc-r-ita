                  Apply skills with developing algorithms and using loops in the
                  context of a visual arts project.

                  Students can approach this project in two different ways: one
                  is to fix the Cartesian coordinates of the virtual strings;
                  and the other is to use a turtle geometry approach in which
                  motions are relative. The initial task for students is
                  probably easier with fixed coordinates, but the Take It
                  Further A, if the students start the projects with relative
                  positions. Either approach is acceptable. The solutions
                  provided use fixed coordinates.

                  Some students may find it difficult to generalize the
                  algorithm they developed to generate the first quadrant of the
                  design and apply it to other quadrants. The first quadrant
                  involves joining <em>positive</em> y-axis points to
                  <em>positive</em> x-axis points, while the second quadrant
                  involves joining positive y-axis points to
                  <em>negative</em> x-axis points, etc. You might help students
                  see this by asking them to draw the design on graph paper and
                  label the connection points.

<li>
                  Students will need headphones or speakers to work on the Music
                  Project. Headphones are recommended to reduce distraction to
                  other students. Pairs may appreciate having two sets of
                  headphones and a headphone splitter, which costs about $5-$10,
                  if working on a computer without two audio output ports.
                </li>
<li>
                  Students familiar with music may want to use fractions (e.g.
                  0.25, 0.5, etc.) to represent note lengths (e.g. quarter
                  notes, half notes, etc.) and adjust the tempo accordingly.
                  Integer note lengths are offered on the lab pages for students
                  unfamiliar with the nuances of representing musical time
                  signatures as decimals (e.g. 0.25 + 0.5 being a full measure
                  in 3/4 time, but not 4/4 time). Integers work just as well and
                  are more forgiving.
                </li>
<li>
                  Consider inviting students with musical training to present
                  basic music theory (especially
                  <!--Not sure what this means: classical note pitch and-->
                  beat length representation) and to share and describe their
                  music script(s) with the class.

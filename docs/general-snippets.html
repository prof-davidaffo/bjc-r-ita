<h2>Page Name</h2>


<p>
        	This lab also introduces a new lab page design element: "If There Is Time." This section is included to provide greater support for differentiation:
			<ul>
<li>"For You to Do" problems should be <strong>completed by all</strong> students</li>
<li>"If There Is Time" should be <strong>attempted by most</strong> students</li>
<li>"Take It Further" is offered <strong>for those students who are moving most quickly</strong>.</li>
</ul>
			The goal of this three-tiered approach is to help teachers keep all students moving through the lab pages at the same pace regardless of the pace of individual pairs.
